<p class="center">“AT LAST I HAVE MET MY FATE.”</p>


<p>“How ridiculously provoking you can be, Harold!”</p>

<p>“I do not think my remarks are ridiculous, Elaine.”</p>

<p>“Your society is decidedly unpleasant when your conversation
takes this morbid strain,” replied Lady Elaine
Seabright.</p>

<p>“I only asked you a natural question, darling,” said
Sir Harold Annesley, an anxious light in his blue eyes.
“I am your accepted lover—your future husband.”</p>

<p>“And in consequence my life is to be made a burden
to me!” the beautiful Elaine exclaimed, pettishly.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid. Every moment of my waking
thoughts shall be devoted to the happiness of my peerless
darling!” He pressed her to him in sudden rapture.</p>

<p>“Harold, you foolish fellow, I wish that you were less
demonstrative. The people on the lawn will see us. I
am sure that papa is looking this way!”</p>

<p>“No, no! We are safe in this bower of beauty,”
laughed Sir Harold.</p>

<p>He pressed another kiss upon her ripe lips, and thanked
Heaven in his heart for the great gift of this girl’s love.</p>

<p>Two short months before, neither dreamt of the other’s
existence. Sir Harold had just returned from an exploring
expedition, and his name was mentioned in the papers.
He was eulogized for his bravery in forcing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
passage to some outlandish place in Africa, and at the
risk of his life rescuing a well-meaning but foolish missionary.
He had been away from home for five long
years, and it was hoped that he would now stay in England
for good. He represented a grand old line; he was
young, handsome, and wealthy. With all these advantages,
it is easy for a man to become popular anywhere.</p>

<p>Lady Elaine Seabright had read this item of news with
languid interest, and immediately forgot it. A week
later it again recurred to her, for at the county ball she
found herself being introduced to Sir Harold Annesley.</p>

<p>She thought that she had never before seen so perfect
a man, and he remarked to his companion, Colonel Greyson,
an hour later, that she was the most beautiful woman
in the whole world.</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you so, Mr. Skeptic?” laughed the
colonel. “Lady Elaine has carried all hearts by storm
from the hour she was launched upon society. She has
had a score of lovers.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold sighed and echoed: “A score of lovers!”</p>

<p>“Yes; all hearts that beat in manly bosoms pay homage
to the most beautiful girl in England. But she has
come scathless out of the ordeal, and is free as air after
two seasons.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” replied Sir Harold; and Colonel
Greyson smiled, meaningly.</p>

<p>“Why should you be glad?” he said. “Why should
you be glad? A confirmed woman-hater! Beware, Sir
Harold!”</p>

<p>The young baronet blushed.</p>

<p>“I am not ashamed to tell you, old friend, that with
me it is love at first sight. I have never loved before; I
have never breathed words of love into any woman’s ear.
At last I have met my fate.”</p>

<p>“Go in and win, my boy. You are worthy of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
woman,” the colonel said; then he looked away, adding,
“this pleasure is only tempered with one regret.”</p>

<p>“One regret, colonel? I do not understand you. Be
frank with me, as you have ever been, my more than
father.”</p>

<p>“Boy, are you not aware that your cousin Margaret
loves you? I believe that she has worshiped you from
her very childhood.”</p>

<p>A shade of annoyance passed over Sir Harold’s face,
but it immediately brightened again.</p>

<p>“Of course, Margaret loves me in a cousinly—a sisterly
way, but it is nothing more, colonel, I assure you. Besides,
I could not marry Margaret Nugent if she were
the only choice left to me. I believe that it is wrong for
cousins to marry.”</p>

<p>Just then he caught sight of Lady Elaine, and he had
eyes for none else.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Greyson, “we must not hide in this recess
like a pair of conspirators. You are the lion of the
evening, Sir Harold, and people will be inquiring for
you.”</p>

<p>They left the conservatory, and a deep sigh, that was
almost a sob, fluttered in the scented air. From behind a
mass of sub-tropical plants emerged the figure of a woman—young
and exquisitely beautiful—a woman with a face
that would have sent Titian into ecstasies of delight. She
was of medium height, and her form was outlined in
graceful, rounded curves. There was not an angle or a
movement to offend the eye of an artist. Her face was
oval, her lips red and full, her eyes dark and luminous,
her hair as black as the raven’s wing. Among the coils
of these matchless tresses was a red rosebud; about her
snowy throat a necklet of rubies, and her dress was of
amber silk.</p>

<p>“He could not marry Margaret Nugent if she were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
only choice left to him!” she murmured, her white hands
tightly clinching themselves. “And is it for this I have
loved and waited all these weary years? Oh, Harold!
how can you be so cruel? You have been my ideal—my
king! More precious than my hopes of heaven! And
now—oh, God, I cannot stand it!”</p>

<p>She sank into the lounge that the gentlemen had just
left, and covered her eyes with her hands, while her lovely
bosom rose and fell with the bitter pangs of her emotion.</p>

<p>The merry strains of the waltz were maddening, and
the laughter of the happy people in the brilliantly illuminated
ballroom made only more apparent her own
misery.</p>

<p>“He has met his fate in Lady Elaine Seabright, and I
had thought him all my own!” she continued, inaudibly.
“I have never liked my proud and haughty friend, and I
now hate her with an undying hatred! She shall not
take from me the man I love! If she does, I swear to
fill her life with bitterness equal to that which I suffer
now!”</p>

<p>Her eyes had grown black, and flashed gleams of fire;
her tiny hands were clinched, and her beautiful form
swelled with fury. In that brief space Margaret Nugent
had changed from a warm-tempered, imperious girl to a
determined and revengeful woman.</p>

<p>Just then some one touched the keys of the piano, and
sang the words of a song that haunted her forever:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alone in crowds to wander on</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And feel that all the charm is gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">While voices dear, and eyes beloved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Shed round us once, where’er we roved—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">This, this, the doom must be</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Of all who’ve loved, and loved to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The few bright things they thought would stay</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">For ever near them, die away.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
    <div class="verse indent1">Though fairer forms around us throng,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Their smiles to others all belong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And want that charm that dwells alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Round those the fond heart calls its own.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where, where the sunny brow?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The long-known voice—where are they now?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Thus ask I still, nor ask in vain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The silence answers all too plain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Oh! what is fancy’s magic worth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If all her art cannot call forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">One bliss like those we felt of old</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">From lips now mute and eyes now cold?</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">No, no—her spell is vain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As soon could she bring back again</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Those eyes themselves from out the grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As ask again one bliss they gave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Margaret Nugent clutched at her heart, gasping: “I
will not lose him—I will never give up my hero-king!”</p>

<p>Again the voice of the singer rose:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alone in crowds to wander on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And feel that all the charm is gone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I shall go mad!” murmured Margaret. “Can I get
out into the moonlight unobserved? The cool air will
soothe my throbbing brain.”</p>

<p>She looked back into the ballroom, and saw Sir Harold
Annesley talking to Lady Elaine Seabright. Lady
Elaine’s flower-like face was turned up to him laughingly,
and Margaret Nugent shivered.</p>

<p>She turned, and gliding from the conservatory, almost
reeled into the vine-wreathed piazza beyond, clutching at
the wall for support.</p>

<p>Even here she could not be alone, for a recumbent figure
started up from a low seat, saying, in anxious tones:</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Margaret, are you faint? I have just come
out myself to escape the heat. Can I get you a glass of
water?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“No, thank you, viscount,” replied Margaret. “I am
already better—much better. The heat is stifling.”</p>

<p>“Would you prefer to be alone, Miss Margaret?” went
on Viscount Rivington, “or will you stroll with me in the
moonlight for a few minutes? It is lovely out here, and
we shall not be missed now.”</p>

<p>He spoke with a tinge of bitterness in his tones. Margaret
looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>“I understand——” she said, gently, yet with a thrill of
satisfaction in her heart, “I understand. Lady Elaine is
as capricious as usual; Lady Elaine seeks new worlds to
conquer!”</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold is the social lion to-night. Every one
bows to him,” he said, “but I will not have him come between
me and the woman I worship, Miss Nugent!”</p>

<p>He turned suddenly upon her.</p>

<p>“You love your cousin—you love Sir Harold. Nay,
how could I help but read your secret when my own heart
is torn with jealous fears? I could curse the fate that
brought him here to-night. Lady Elaine had promised to
consider my suit; her father, the earl, was pleased to welcome
me as a favored lover; but now I am extinguished!”</p>

<p>He glanced vengefully toward the gleaming windows
just as two people in the room beyond paused to drink in
the beauty of the moonlight. The brilliant lights behind
them made every movement distinct.</p>

<p>“See!” Viscount Rivington whispered. “There they
are, Miss Nugent—the woman I love and the man whom
you covet. Are we to stand idly by while all that life
holds dear drifts away?”</p>

<p>“No!” she said, and their eyes met. They understood
each other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A RIFT IN THE LUTE.</p>


<p>“She is the loveliest girl in all England,” the papers
said, when the engagement of Sir Harold Annesley and
Lady Elaine Seabright was announced. “And Sir Harold
is the lion of the season. Both are extremely wealthy,
and it is in every way a most suitable match.”</p>

<p>The wooing and winning had been short and decisive.
It was love at first sight on both sides, and the Earl
of Seabright was gratified that his beautiful but capricious
daughter was at last conquered.</p>

<p>He was an easy-going nobleman of the old school, intensely
proud of his ancient line, but indolent to a selfish
degree where the best interests of his only child were
concerned.</p>

<p>He wished to see her well married, but did not care
whom to so long as there was no blemish on his prospective
son-in-law’s name. The man’s private character
was nothing to him if he could boast of wealth and an
ancient pedigree.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, my boy,” he said, genially, to Sir
Harold. “My willful beauty has been endless trouble to
me. All the men at her feet, you know, and if you had
not come upon the scene so opportunely, she would have
struck her colors to Viscount Rivington, I verily believe.
Poor fellow! It will be no end of an upset for him.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold frowned.</p>

<p>“I do not think that Elaine ever dreamed of such a
thing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” laughed the earl; “if you are satisfied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
what does it matter? One word, my boy; deal gently
with her. She is very young, and has never yet been
thwarted. ‘Happy’s the wooing that’s not long a-doing,’
you know, but these sudden engagements are apt to be as
quickly broken.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold could not forget the words of the earl for
some days. The impression left from them was far from
pleasant. He was giving all to the woman he loved—the
past, the present, and the future—and he expected an undivided
return.</p>

<p>So rapid had been the wooing that the plans of Margaret
Nugent and Viscount Rivington had not been permitted
formation. It was as impossible to keep these two
apart as to keep the needle from the magnet.</p>

<p>An early marriage had been suggested by the impatient
lover, and Elaine was not averse to anything which would
please Sir Harold. She worshiped him as a being far
above her, though at times his jealous fears pained her
bitterly.</p>

<p>This takes the reader back to the opening words of our
story.</p>

<p>Sir Harold was an almost daily visitor at Seabright
Hall. His own estate was but ten miles distant, and,
mounted upon his favorite horse, his had become a
familiar figure to the rustics of Seabright.</p>

<p>It was a warm July day, and the few visitors at the
Hall were sunning themselves on the lawn, and listening
to my lord’s sporting reminiscences, while the lovers had
wandered to a bower festooned with roses and fragrant
clematis.</p>

<p>“But you have not answered my question, Elaine,” Sir
Harold went on, and there was an earnestness in his tones
that surprised her.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes toward him—lustrous eyes, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
pansies wet with dew, saying, “Harold, I believe that you
are jealous, and I dislike jealous people.”</p>

<p>“Then I am to understand that you dislike me?” he
smiled; but there was an undercurrent of sadness in his
voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling! how foolish you are! Why will you
tease me so?”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine clung to him in a passion of love, and yet
he was far from being satisfied.</p>

<p>“I believe that I am of a jealous nature,” he said. “It
is one of the misfortunes of my race.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you call it a misfortune,” the girl observed,
her lips trembling, “and I sincerely trust that you
will never be jealous of me, Harold. Where there is
jealousy there cannot be true love. You must trust me
all in all, or not at all!”</p>

<p>He was silent for a few minutes, and gnawed his mustache
impatiently.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he said, at last, “I have laid bare my life
to you. My notions of love and marriage may seem peculiar,
but the thought that the woman I love had ever
willingly accepted the attentions of another man would
be torture to me. I have never had a sweetheart before,
I have never pressed my lips to those of a girl, or
written one line of nonsense to any woman living. I
give you all—unreservedly—my first and my last love.”</p>

<p>She waited for him to continue, her heart burning resentfully.</p>

<p>“I know that I am accounted the luckiest and most enviable
mortal on earth because I have stepped in and
taken the prize that so many sighed for in vain; but,
Elaine, my darling, now that we are engaged, it maddens
me to see such men as Viscount Rivington forever dancing
attendance upon you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Harold,” she said, calmly, “what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“You must show by your manners that—that——”</p>

<p>“I cannot be rude to my father’s friend,” she replied,
decidedly. “You are asking too much, Sir Harold. You
insult me.”</p>

<p>He had seized her hand in a moment, and was showering
kisses upon it.</p>

<p>“No, no, Elaine, a thousand times no! It is only my
great love for you that makes me so exacting. You will
forgive me, darling, when I tell you that I have heard
from several people that you were all but engaged to Viscount
Rivington, when I arrived in England, but two
short months since. I want you to deny this, and I shall
be eternally satisfied.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine had turned as pale as death.</p>

<p>“I do deny it, Sir Harold, unequivocally.”</p>

<p>She looked at him fearlessly, and his heart smote him.</p>

<p>“My dear love,” he whispered, remorsefully, “I am
satisfied. I will never doubt you again. This has been
a bitter torture to me. Your father hinted at it long ago,
and—and——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Her tones were cold and hard.</p>

<p>“You told me that it was not true.”</p>

<p>“And you have listened to other falsehoods—to other
childish tittle-tattle. Oh, Harold! what will my future
life be if I wed a jealous man?”</p>

<p>“It shall never occur again, my darling. Do not punish
me more, I beseech you!” cried Sir Harold.</p>

<p>“Why do you not question the viscount?” she demanded,
scornfully.</p>

<p>Then she bowed her head and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>Sir Harold returned home that evening with a heavy
heart. For the first time since their engagement he and
Elaine had not exchanged a kiss at parting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>She had persistently remained in her own apartments,
and at a late hour he had ridden away to Annesley Park,
his heart torn with conflicting doubts and fears.</p>

<p>And Viscount Henry Rivington saw through it all and
smiled.</p>

his kind. He was young, wealthy and famous; possessed
of a splendid physique, and the representative of an old
and honorable line. There was no blot on the escutcheon
of the Annesleys; the men had ever been noble and brave,
and the women good and virtuous.</p>

<p>In addition to these splendid attributes and honors, Sir
Harold had won the fairest and loveliest woman in all
England. Dukes and princes had sighed vainly at her
feet. She had been the beauty of two seasons, and had
nearly turned the brains of a score of men, but to one
and all was Lady Elaine the same. Kindly and gracious,
but as cold as an icicle when there was the danger of an
avowal.</p>

<p>Some of these disappointed lovers declared that she was
a coquette; others that she had no human passions—no
heart.</p>

<p>At last her father, my lord of Seabright, spoke to her
seriously upon the subject of marriage.</p>

<p>“It must come some day, Elaine. Surely among all
your acquaintances you must have some preference?”</p>

<p>“No,” the girl replied. “All men are alike. It is
dreadful that they must all pretend to fall in love with
me.” Her lips curled with scorn. “I do not think,” she
added, “that one man in a hundred knows anything of the
professions he makes use of so glibly.”</p>

<p>The earl stared at her in surprise. “Why should you
think so, Elaine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“They are passionately in love to-day, and speaking
unkindly of me to-morrow. Is that love?”</p>

<p>The earl did not feel competent to argue the point, so
he wisely evaded the question by saying:</p>

<p>“Well, let us hope that you will be able to return the
affection of some one before many months are past—Viscount
Rivington, for instance. He is young, handsome,
and comes of a great family. He will be a duke some
day, and is very much in love with you.”</p>

<p>“So that these men are of ancient lineage, papa, it does
not seem to concern you whether it is possible for me to
love them or not,” Lady Elaine replied.</p>

<p>“My dear, I sincerely hope that you could not bring
yourself to care for what is termed a man of the people,”
the earl exclaimed, in alarm.</p>

<p>“And why not, if he were a gentleman?” laughed
Elaine. “There, papa, why should we talk of these
things? I like Viscount Rivington better than any one
else, because he does not rave about broken hearts and
suicide; but as for the love that poets sing about, I fear
that I am incapable of experiencing it. In my early girlhood
it was a beautiful dream that lay before me like an
enchanted garden. Now I am becoming worldly and
skeptical. I have not met my prince, and fear that my
ideal lives only in my dreams.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense these poets put into the heads of
girls!” my lord remarked. “Their trash does an incalculable
amount of harm, and ought to be made a bonfire of.
However, I am glad that you are beginning to see the
value of it, my child. Try and think well of Rivington.
He is a capital fellow.”</p>

<p>After that Lady Elaine treated the viscount kindly, and
he at once fancied that he was her favored suitor. Then
Sir Harold Annesley appeared, and the beautiful Elaine
knew that her prince had come at last! With one glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Sir Harold won this peerless creature, and to all his
other honors was added this victory. And yet he was
not happy!</p>

<p>No sooner was the prize assured than he began to make
himself and Elaine miserable by his quixotic notions of
the love of twin souls. The words of the Earl of Seabright
haunted him when he spoke of Viscount Rivington
in connection with Lady Elaine, and while congratulating
him, his cousin Margaret had expressed astonishment that
the earl’s daughter could so quickly transfer her affections
from one to the other.</p>

<p>“But it is not true,” Sir Harold had said; “she never
cared for the viscount.”</p>

<p>“Everybody thought that there was a tacit engagement
at least,” Margaret said, “and, of course,” she added,
brightly, “everybody may have been mistaken! People
are always ready to take an interest in other people’s love
affairs. Hundreds of engagements are made in this
way, which really have no foundation in fact.”</p>

<p>“It is a great pity that such busybodies have nothing
better with which to employ themselves.”</p>

<p>“It will always be the same,” his cousin replied, indifferently,
“so long as unscrupulous society papers are
permitted to print the items sent in to them by vicious-minded
people who make money out of their news. Still,
there is rarely smoke without fire, Harold, and I was certainly
under the impression that Lady Elaine favored the
viscount.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold felt vexed and irritable, and after this he
was never weary of hearing Elaine declare that she had
given him her first enduring love.</p>

<p>“Suppose that you had never seen me?” he would say;
“what then?”</p>

<p>The bare possibility, even in imagination, of the woman
he loved ever caring for another troubled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>His persistence became painful to Lady Elaine. It
seemed that he had not implicit trust in her. She who
had been so cold and haughty to others—the spoiled child
of an indulgent father, the pet of society—became almost
a slave to the caprices of her lover.</p>

<p>But my lady became indignant at last, and after their
interview in the summer arbor she sent for Margaret Nugent—she
sent for the cousin who knew Sir Harold’s
moods, and would perhaps be able to advise her.</p>

<p>Miss Nugent listened, and there was a well-assumed
sympathy in her eyes, in her voice—while her heart was
throbbing with triumph.</p>

<p>“You must not let him have his way in all things, Lady
Elaine,” she said. “Time enough for that after marriage.
You will lose your self-respect, and he will not
value you any the more for that!”</p>

<p>“I think that you are right, Margaret, and I thank you
from the bottom of my heart. He shall not find me so
childish in the future. In my great love for him I may
have acted weakly. I am the daughter of an earl,” she
added, proudly.</p>

<p>There was a resolute ring in her tones, and her head
resumed its haughty pose.</p>

<p>So when Sir Harold came to the Hall next day, an expectant
smile upon his lips, a resolve in his heart to beg
Elaine’s pardon, and to promise never to offend her again,
he was informed by a servant that my lady had gone for a
ride, and that she was accompanied by Viscount Rivington.</p>

<p>His face turned so white that the man noticed it, and
asked:</p>

<p>“Are you ill, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>“No,” he returned, shortly. “Which way did her ladyship
go?”</p>

<p>“In the direction of Ashbourne, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>The baronet rode away, and as he galloped through the
park, he saw Viscount Rivington and Lady Elaine crossing
a distant hill on their return home.</p>

<p>His brain was on fire. He dared not meet them now,
and continued on his way—anywhere.</p>

<p>For three days he nursed his jealous wrath, and heard
no word of Elaine. Then news came to him of a garden
party at Seabright Hall, to be followed by a ball.</p>

<p>He could bear it no longer. He was consumed with
love and wounded pride.</p>

<p>“I have given her all,” he told himself; “and get but
half a heart in return. She must be everything to me, or
nothing!”</p>

<p>He rode over to the Hall, but it was not the happy
lover; it was a man with a stern, white face.</p>

<p>He left his horse in charge of a groom, and asked for
Lady Elaine.</p>

<p>“I will wait in the west drawing-room,” he told the
footman. “Let her ladyship know that I am here as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p>He paced the floor impatiently, until he saw a vision of
loveliness crossing the lawn toward the house. It was
Lady Elaine, attired in a diaphanous dress of snowy
white. She wore a broad-brimmed straw hat, and in her
hands were bunches of wild flowers.</p>

<p>“My darling!” he murmured. “Oh, what a brute I
am. If she is weak and frail, then Heaven itself is false!”</p>

<p>In a little while she came into the room, and his words
of welcome died on his lips, for in the eyes of Elaine
there was no answering smile.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” he whispered, hoarsely, “is this the best
greeting you have for me?”</p>

<p>“Why have you absented yourself, Sir Harold, without
one word of explanation?” she asked, with studied coldness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>He instantly resented this by saying: “Absented myself?
The last time I called you appeared to be enjoying
more congenial society.”</p>

<p>“It is a relief to be beyond range of your unreasonable
temper sometimes,” Lady Elaine said.</p>

<p>“Oh, my love, this is terrible for me to bear!”</p>

<p>“You think only of yourself, Sir Harold.” Her lips
quivered. “You think only of yourself. I have been too
childish and yielding.”</p>

<p>“It is the duty of woman to yield,” he retorted.</p>

<p>“I beg to differ with you. I do not propose to be your
slave,” Lady Elaine responded, bitterly.</p>

<p>There was silence for a little while—a silence that
neither ever forgot.</p>

<p>“We must have an understanding, Elaine,” Sir Harold
said, at last. “Do not let false pride stand between us,
my darling. I was angry when I heard that you were
out with Rivington. I saw you together, and it maddened
me. I do not think it right for an engaged woman
to listen to the flattery of any man.”</p>

<p>She laughed musically.</p>

<p>“No? I suppose that you consider me your slave? I
object to being any man’s slave, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, my dear love,” he pleaded. “Who
speaks of slavery! Oh, why will you misunderstand me?
Have I not lavished upon you the whole wealth of my
affection? Are you not my ideal of all that is good and
beautiful in woman?”</p>

<p>“And yet you do not trust me. I cannot understand
such love as that,” Elaine said.</p>

<p>He held out his arms, and she was not proof against
this, but her determination to maintain her independence
remained unshaken. Had she not already scored a victory?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>For a few minutes he caressed her fondly, his face
rapturously happy.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing now,” he told her, “that stands
between us and heaven itself. Can you guess what it is,
darling?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied. “How should I know?”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you, dear.” He held her away from
him at arm’s length. “I want you to promise me that
you will not ride out with Viscount Rivington again?”</p>

<p>She drew away from him, her head erect.</p>

<p>“It is impossible, Sir Harold; I am not your wife yet,
remember!”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he echoed. “Why, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“I decline to answer. If the Viscount desires my society
I cannot very well refuse it. He is an old friend
and neighbor. As your wife you may command me, but
again I repeat I am not yet your wife.”</p>

<p>“And never will be,” Sir Harold replied, with terrible
calmness, “unless you respect my wishes now.”</p>

<p>She endeavored to slip his ring from her finger, but was
seized with an awful faintness.</p>

<p>“I believe that it will kill me if I lose you, Elaine,” he
went on, “but I cannot marry a woman who accepts the
attentions of other men. I will leave you to think it over,
and to decide between me and Rivington. Bah! how I
loathe his name! If you love me as I love you my happiness
is safe. If you will not give me your promise, I
swear that I will never willingly look upon your face
again.”</p>

<p>He sprang toward her and pressed her passionately to
his heart; he showered a hundred kisses on her face
mingled with tears that seemed scalding hot.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Elaine! I can stand this no longer,” he
groaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>He rushed from the room, and for a long time Lady
Elaine Seabright was like one in a dark dream.</p>

<p>Her first impulse when she recovered her numbed
senses was to cry:</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, my darling, come back to me!”</p>

<p>Then Margaret Nugent was announced, and Lady
Elaine told her all.</p>

<p>“You have nearly conquered him,” smiled Margaret.
“He is merely trying to frighten you. How well I know
him of old! He was always a wayward, headstrong,
loving boy. As children we had our little quarrels
through his overbearing temper, but he always acknowledged
at last that he was in the wrong; I will say that
for him, and it will be the same with you, Lady Elaine.
He will come back to you and confess his faults; he will
be so humble when he realizes that you refuse to encourage
his caprices, and let us hope that the lesson will be a
wholesome one.”</p>

<p>“But there was a strange look in his eyes that I have
never seen there before,” Lady Elaine said, piteously.
“Oh, Margaret, are you sure that your counsel is good?
Are you sure that you understand this strange jealousy
that has come between me and my lover?”</p>

<p>Miss Nugent replied confidently, and for a time her
words carried consolation to the suffering heart.</p>

<p>“I know Sir Harold far better than I know myself,”
she said. “I know the mood he is in exactly. Long,
long ago, when we were children, he left one of his pet
birds for me to feed and care for. Let me confess that
I neglected it, and it died—poor, little thing. When my
cousin came home his rage was terrible. I thought then
that I should never be forgiven. He declared that he
would never look upon me again—that he hated me. His
passions are violent always. But he apologized a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
days later, Lady Elaine, and he will come back to you in
the same way. I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>Miss Nugent went away thinking, “I shall win Harold
yet—I, who have loved him for years, and have the greatest
right to him!”</p>

<p>The next morning’s post brought a letter to Sir Harold—a
letter bearing the Seabright crest.</p>

<p>At sight of it his haggard face lighted up with sudden
hope, and he kissed the dear writing tenderly; then he
broke the seal and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harold</span>—Much as I love you, I cannot sacrifice my self-respect
by making the foolish promise you requested.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Elaine.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“My God!” he gasped, a stony glare in his eyes. “And
so it has come to this! All is at an end!”</p>

<p>He retired to his study, and his valet kept watch at the
door. He feared that Sir Harold meant to end his life.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">COLONEL GREYSON’S MISSION.</p>


<p>“She is heartless, soulless!” groaned Sir Harold. “Oh,
Elaine, why should you be so fair and fickle?”</p>

<p>He paced the floor like a man distraught. His eyes
were bloodshot, his face ashy pale. This misery was
more bitter than death.</p>

<p>He had given the one great love of his life; he had
tasted the most ecstatic bliss that had ever fallen to
mortal man. But, after all, he had only been reveling in
a fool’s paradise. He had believed that the earl’s daughter
loved him beyond all earthly things; that this was no
idyllic dream, but the meeting of two sympathetic twin
souls—a beautiful reality.</p>

<p>When the first storm of his misery had nearly subsided,
he sank into a chair, and buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>The Earl of Seabright had warned him to deal gently
with Lady Elaine. She was so young, so willful, so
utterly spoiled.</p>

<p>“These sudden engagements are apt to be as quickly
broken,” my lord had said, and now his words rang like
the knell of doom in Sir Harold’s ears. Was all at an
end between them? Was their quarrel to be the subject
of a nine days’ wonder? The society papers would enlarge
upon it. Innumerable five-o’clock teas would be enlivened
by it, and then it would be forgotten by everybody
but Sir Harold.</p>

<p>Thus he reasoned, and he felt that his heart would be
broken, that it would be forever dead.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be better so. She does not love me—she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
does not love as I love. I do not want half a heart.
I will go away, and the sooner I am dead the better it will
be for me. My life has ever been a bitter mistake. I
am a visionary, and my last delusion will kill me!”</p>

<p>It was a relief to John Stimson, Sir Harold’s valet, that
he had a legitimate cause for knocking at the door of his
master’s study. A footman had appeared bearing the
card of Colonel Greyson on a salver.</p>

<p>“He told me to see that he was not disturbed on any
account,” he muttered; “but I shall risk it. I didn’t like
the look in his face when he went into the study, and the
awful silence within makes me uneasy.”</p>

<p>He took the salver from the footman, saying:</p>

<p>“All right. I will attend to this. Sir Harold is engaged.
Where is Colonel Greyson?”</p>

<p>“In the blue drawing-room,” the footman replied.</p>

<p>“Thank you; that will do,” said the valet, as he tapped
gently on the door.</p>

<p>To his surprise it was opened at once, and his master
took the card with an exclamation of impatience.</p>

<p>“I told you not to disturb me, Stimson,” he said,
harshly.</p>

<p>“But you never refuse to see the colonel, Sir Harold,
and I felt anxious about you.”</p>

<p>Stimson was a privileged servant. He had traveled
over half the globe with his young master, and had nursed
him through the yellow fever in an African swamp.</p>

<p>“You are ill, master, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Ill?” echoed Sir Harold. “No, I am not ill. I wish
to heaven that I were sick unto death!”</p>

<p>It was a strange speech, but Stimson pretended not to
notice it. He merely said:</p>

<p>“You will see Colonel Greyson, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will see him here, in my study,” was the gloomy
reply, and when Stimson had gone he added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“He it was who introduced us, and who more fitting to
be the first to hear that we are parted forever?”</p>

<p>Then the colonel’s bluff tones fell upon his ears; and he
felt his hand being shaken warmly.</p>

<p>“I have not seen much of you for weeks, my boy,” he
was saying; “but suddenly determined to make an assault
upon you. In your bower of bliss, presided over by
I don’t know how many Cupids, you seem to forget that
you are necessary, to a small extent at least, to your
neighbors.”</p>

<p>Every word was like the stab of a knife, and Sir Harold,
his heart too full for words, made a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p>However, the colonel went on without noticing the
agony of his young friend. The study was a dark room
at any time, when no artificial light was used, and Colonel
Greyson was notoriously short-sighted.</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy, we are organizing a steeplechase. Now,
don’t tell me that you cannot ride, or that you have other
engagements. You must have a little consideration for
the county. I want you to become even more popular
than you are already, and we may yet run you for a seat
in the House.”</p>

<p>“Colonel,” broke in Sir Harold, “why will you torture
me in this way?”</p>

<p>His voice was so harsh that the old soldier promptly
pulled himself up, and began to search for his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“Torture you, eh? Egad, what is wrong with the boy?
Confound it, sir, what is the trouble? You, whom I account
one of the most fortunate men of the century, talking
of torture!</p>

<p>“Is it torture to be a rich man? Is it torture to be
young, handsome, famous and engaged to the loveliest
woman under the sun? I tell you what it is, my boy, you
are one of Fortune’s spoiled darlings, and have been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
much surfeited with good things that you do not know
what is best for you! Now, as you have hitherto professed
to have implicit confidence in my common sense, I
intend prescribing for you. My dear fellow, the county
cannot possibly get on without you, and I am sure that
you cannot get along without the county! It is my ambition
to see you at the very top of the political tree, and
if you take the thing in hand I am pretty certain as to the
result, for your abilities are far beyond the average, and
only want bringing out. Now, about this little scheme of
mine—this steeplechase——”</p>

<p>“Sit down, colonel,” Sir Harold interrupted, closing the
door. “I have something to tell you that will drive
steeplechasing out of your head, so far as I am concerned.
I did not intend speaking of my misery to any living soul,
but my confidence is due to you, old friend, though I do
not solicit advice. I know my own case only too well!”</p>

<p>Colonel Greyson listened like a man in a stupor, but he
had no suspicion of the nature of Sir Harold’s trouble
until it was revealed to him in words that seemed to
quiver with agony.</p>

<p>“Only a lovers’ quarrel,” he interjected.</p>

<p>“No, colonel, it is no ordinary affair. Mine is no ordinary
love; it is life or death to me. I have not shaped my
life in any stereotyped pattern. I have always been
afraid of linking my fate with another, because I am so
intense in all that I profess. It is my misfortune. I believed
that Lady Elaine was capable of loving after my
fashion of loving, but I was wrong, and I wish you to
understand that I do not blame her, though my disappointment
will embitter my whole life.”</p>

<p>“You must see her again,” said the colonel, “and I’ll
wager that it is nothing but a storm in a teacup.”</p>

<p>“No, I could not bear the agony of another interview.
I have appealed to her in vain. The reply she has sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to me is final. The engagement is at an end, and the
world may judge as it pleases. I do not suppose that
Lady Elaine will care one jot.”</p>

<p>“You wrong her,” Colonel Greyson retorted, a little
angrily. “I have known Lady Elaine from childhood.
She is as good as she is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“I admit that. But, oh, the agony of knowing that
she is soulless!”</p>

<p>“I will not listen to such nonsense!” fumed the colonel.
“I will see her myself. It is a duty I owe to both of you,
for, in a measure, I brought you together. Curse Viscount
Rivington! I say—though I have no doubt that
your own insane jealousy is at the root of all the trouble.
No young woman of spirit would put up with it. I am
determined to hear both sides of the story.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>“I will not be content to have the matter patched up,”
he said. “My wife must be all in all to me. My ideal is
in my dreams, and to that alone will I be wedded.”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” interrupted the colonel, inelegantly. “All
stuff, sir, depend upon it! Lady Elaine Seabright will
be your wife, and a more perfect woman never breathed!”</p>

<p>To accentuate this Colonel Greyson brought his fist
down upon the table with a bang.</p>

<p>“Heaven help me!” went on Sir Harold. “I loved her
as I believed her to be, not as she is, and shall do so for
evermore!”</p>

<p>“Once again,” pleaded the colonel, “I ask you to see
her. You are acting like an insane man. Why will you
wreck two lives when——”</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t! It is impossible!” groaned the baronet.
“If she will not grant me one reasonable request, with
the full knowledge that she will lose me, it is proof positive
that her love is a mere chimera, a passing fancy, undefinable
and worthless! No, colonel, all is at an end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and I shall leave Annesley Park to-night. My affairs
shall be put into the hands of my men of business in London,
and I pray to God that I may never set foot in the
place again! My heart is broken! I have one request
to make of you, old friend, and that is to correct any
wrong impressions that get abroad. Spare Lady Elaine
all that may be annoying, and if any one has to bear the
blame, let it be me. We part now, probably never to
meet again, and I wish you to take my farewell to my
cousin, Margaret Nugent.”</p>

<p>The colonel jumped to his feet, tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>He held out his hand, replying huskily:</p>

<p>“I will do all that you ask of me, you foolish fellow,
and probably a great deal more. I hope to see you again,
though,” he added, energetically. “I will see you again!
You must excuse my haste; I have several important matters
needing my attention. Good-by!”</p>

<p>He scarcely gave Sir Harold time to reply, but dashed
out of the room into the hall, seized his hat and commanded
a servant to see that a horse was saddled for him
at once.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the animal was brought to the door,
and the colonel galloped at a mad pace toward Ashbourne,
the seat of the Earl of Seabright.</p>

<p>“The boy is full of cranky, quixotic notions,” he
thought, “and my lady is too high-spirited and proud to
pander to all his follies. As a consequence, he would
ruin two lives. The county cannot afford it. What does
she care for that dandyfied ass of a Rivington? Not one
iota! I consider that the girl has acted very properly.
Does he want to shut her out of the world entirely? By
Jove, I feel that I could give him a piece of my mind!”</p>

<p>When he arrived at Seabright Hall, his horse dripping
with foam, the first person he encountered in the vestibule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
was Viscount Rivington, who regarded him in wonderment.</p>

<p>“One of Annesley’s horses,” he observed. “Why,
colonel, one would think that you were the bearer of important
dispatches! You must be living over again the
days when you were a military aide-de-camp on active
service.”</p>

<p>“Where is the earl?” demanded the colonel, brusquely.
Then he added fiercely, his gray eyes flashing under his
bristling brows: “See here, Rivington, you are causing
trouble between two young people who love each other
dearly. If you are a gentleman, you must stop it. D’ye
hear?”</p>

<p>“No man ever dared say that I am not a gentleman!”
retorted the viscount, flushing hotly.</p>

<p>“Then prove that you are worthy of the name,” the
colonel said, “or I may have to stigmatize you as a blackguard!
We men of the old school are still ready to back
our words at the sword’s point!”</p>

<p>So saying, Colonel Greyson stalked away in quest of
Lady Elaine, while Viscount Rivington watched him with
gathering fury in his black eyes.</p>

<p class="center">“IF HE HAD ONLY COME HIMSELF.”</p>


<p>“Show me into a room where I am not likely to be interrupted,”
the old soldier said to the footman who
stepped forward. “And tell Lady Elaine that I am here
upon a matter of great urgency.”</p>

<p>The footman grasped the situation with alacrity. The
colonel was a favorite with everybody. His liberality, if
not his past record for deeds of valor, entitled him to respect,
particularly in the servants’ hall.</p>

<p>Colonel Greyson was ushered into a small private
library, and ten minutes later Lady Elaine entered the
room, her eyes anxious, troubled and expectant.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Elaine!” the old soldier said. He always
addressed the earl’s daughter with easy familiarity.</p>

<p>Her ladyship faintly responded to his greeting.</p>

<p>“There, sit down, my dear, and compose yourself. Why,
you are trembling as though with cold, while I am boiling
with perspiration and bad temper!”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine obeyed, smiling in a wintry sort of way.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was my duty to see your father first,” the
old soldier began, “but as he is anything but a sympathetic
man where young people’s love affairs are concerned,
I have come direct to you, my dear.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine paled, and her heart throbbed wildly.</p>

<p>“You have heard?” she hazarded.</p>

<p>“I have heard that two young people who passionately
love each other are trying their utmost to drift into the
shoals of misery,” he replied, kindly.</p>

<p>“Has Sir Harold told you anything?” she demanded,
proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>It seemed to her a strange thing to do. Why should
he make their little differences public?</p>

<p>The colonel was quick to notice this.</p>

<p>“Elaine,” he said, “I called at Annesley Park to try
and induce Sir Harold to interest himself in local affairs.
To my utter astonishment I found him in the very depths
of despair.”</p>

<p>The tears started to the girl’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, although I have been like a father to the lad, I
had some difficulty in learning the cause of his misery.
At last he told me, in a disjointed way, that his engagement—that
your engagement, was at an end, and that he
was upon the point of starting for some outlandish place,
never to return. I told him that it was all stuff, but he
assured me that you preferred some one else to him, and I
have galloped over here to know what is really the matter.
You are just sending the lad to his death!”</p>

<p>“Oh, colonel, why will you be so unkind to me?” Elaine
whispered.</p>

<p>“Because he is a fool!” blurted out the old soldier,
angrily. “My dear, you did a very silly thing in sending
him some letter that he mentioned. Why not undo the
mischief at once? What do you care about Viscount Rivington?
Nothing!”</p>

<p>“I hate him,” said Lady Elaine, “but I cannot insult a
guest whom my father honors. Why will Sir Harold be
so unreasonably jealous? Why will he not trust me as I
trust him?”</p>

<p>“You must pocket your pride, my dear. I don’t pretend
to take sides with Harold, but you must admit that
he never runs after any other girls. Indeed, he is barely
civil to any other woman except yourself. He is a romantic
sort of fellow, a modern knight-errant, full of
poetry, chivalry and all that kind of thing. His friendship
or his love nothing will alter when once given. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
is an idealist, and being so much out of the common run
of simpering, deceitful dandies, merits a peculiar consideration.
With all these super-excellent qualities, he
is as stupid as a mule, and if you don’t want to lose him
you must call him back to you—that’s the beginning and
the end of it!”</p>

<p>For a little while Lady Elaine was silent. Then she
paced the floor like an insulted queen. It was a struggle
between love and pride.</p>

<p>“I will think it over, Colonel Greyson,” she said, tremulously.
“I will think it over, and——”</p>

<p>“You will wait until it is too late, child. The mad-brained
fellow will be gone past recall,” the old soldier
said, vigorously.</p>

<p>“Oh, what am I to do?” was her piteous cry. “I have
no one to advise me!”</p>

<p>“Am I not advising you? Let me go back to Annesley
Park and tell him that you wish to see him.”</p>

<p>“But that would mean unconditional surrender,” Lady
Elaine replied, with a flash of scorn. “I will not be
treated like a willful child—no, not if my heart were
rended to atoms! What wrong have I done? Sir Harold
listens to every scrap of tittle-tattle and believes it.
You have come to champion his cause, Colonel Greyson,
and in your heart you think that I am all to blame.”</p>

<p>“No—no!” he protested. “You are both equally foolish.
If you had seen him as I have seen him this morning,
you would throw your pride to the winds. Do not
let me go away feeling that my efforts have been in vain.
My child, I am old enough to be your father. I am a man
of the world, who has experienced the bitterness and
misery of such folly as this.”</p>

<p>“If he had come himself!” murmured Elaine. “If he
had only come himself!”</p>

<p>“Shall I give him that message?” was the eager question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
“Yes, I will tell him that you wish to see him—that
you have relented.”</p>

<p>For a minute the girl was silent. Would it be fair to
Margaret Nugent? Had she not kindly counseled her—counseled
her with the best of intentions? And to ignore
her would be ungrateful—cruel!</p>

<p>“No, you must take no message from me yet,” she
said, imperiously. “You are probably exaggerating
things, Colonel Greyson, in your anxiety to bring about a
reconciliation. You must not forget that, as Sir Harold
Annesley’s wife, I may have to live through many years
of such jealous torture as this, unless I analyze his true
character before marriage.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense—what arrant nonsense!” the colonel
exclaimed, bitterly. “I had believed you until now to be
possessed of sound reason. Lady Elaine, I must say
that, however severe your punishment may be, you will
well deserve it, and my words may recur to you again
in your hour of grief—when it will be too late—too late!”</p>

<p>He had not intended to be so harsh, but he could not
help it.</p>

<p>“You are presuming, sir!” she flashed, haughtily. “I
have no desire for your censorship.”</p>

<p>“No, my lady; your own conscience will be quite
enough to bear with!”</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet and turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“At least,” he said, “let us part friends. I have nothing
but pity for you, Lady Elaine.”</p>

<p>His tender tones were more than she could bear, and
for a little while she wept unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>“If you had cared for him as I believed,” he went on,
but she interrupted him with a passionate cry.</p>

<p>“Love him! I worship my darling with all the
strength of my being! Oh, colonel, my pride is broken—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
barrier is swept away! I will send a message to
him to-day!”</p>

<p>“Can I tell him this?” he asked, joyously.</p>

<p>“No. You must grant me the favor of not doing so.
You can say that you have seen me, but no more. Promise,
colonel!”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will obey my lady’s behest,” he said, reluctantly.
“When will you send this blessed relief to a
tortured soul?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon—by one whom I can trust to deliver
it with his own hands.”</p>

<p>“You have made a happy man of me, Elaine. On second
thought, I will not go back to Annesley Park until
I can meet Sir Harold, and see the light of hope and happiness
once more in his face. My dear, he will be at your
side within an hour of receiving your message, if horse-flesh
can carry him. You will rescue a man from the
brink of inferno—a man who loves you as woman was
never loved before! Good-by! Every moment is precious,
and I will not be the cause of one being lost.”</p>

<p>He pressed her trembling fingers tightly, warm tears
springing into his eyes. Then with a whispered
“Heaven bless both of you!” he left the library.</p>

<p>Lady Elaine heard him ride away, and with a happy
resolve in her heart sought her own apartments.</p>

<p>In one of the passages she encountered Viscount Rivington,
quite unconscious that he had purposely placed
himself in her path.</p>

<p>“My dear Lady Elaine,” he said, “I have been in
agonies lest the weather should be unpropitious and upset
our plans for a ride to-day.”</p>

<p>“I do not think that I shall go out this morning, viscount,”
Lady Elaine said, sweetly.</p>

<p>“But your promise of yesterday!” he exclaimed, biting
his lips with vexation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“You are not unkind enough to hold me to it when I
particularly wish to be released?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I am only disappointed,” he replied, bowing. “It is
like a black cloud obscuring golden sunshine to be so
suddenly deprived of the anticipation of so sweet a pleasure.”</p>

<p>She thanked him and passed on. But had she seen the
scowl of rage and hate that distorted the viscount’s features,
my lady would never have tolerated him even as an
acquaintance again.</p>

<p>Elaine’s first step was to send a servant in quest of
Margaret Nugent. The Nugents, mother and daughter,
lived on the outskirts of Ashbourne, and within two miles
of Seabright Hall. Mrs. Nugent was not a wealthy
woman, but she and her handsome daughter were in comfortable
circumstances.</p>

<p>“Nina,” Lady Elaine said to her maid, “I want you to
go to The Ferns, Mrs. Nugent’s place, and to ask Miss
Margaret to come to the Hall at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>“You will be sure to impress upon Miss Nugent the
urgency of losing no time, Nina. And, Nina, you may
use the pony carriage if you do not care for the walk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady. Thank you.”</p>

<p>The maid withdrew, and secure in the privacy of her
own apartments, Lady Elaine prepared to write one of the
sweetest letters she had ever written to the man she
loved.</p>

<p>“My dear love!” she murmured. “I feel that I have
misjudged you. I will never bother you again with my
silly caprices. Oh, how bright and beautiful the world
seems, now that my king will soon be with me again!”</p>

<p>She drew before her a pearl-enameled writing desk,
and, having opened it, penned the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Darling Harold</span>—Can you ever forgive me for being so
cruel to you? I have myself suffered agonies that words cannot
paint. Come back to me, my love! I will confess that I detest
Viscount Rivington, and promise you that in future your wishes
shall be my law. My pride is humbled to the dust, and you will
never be jealous of me again. I can write no more; only come to
me! Forever your own.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Elaine.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>She wrote the loving words with glowing cheeks and
eyes beaming with happiness. Then she sealed up the
letter, and kissed it again and again.</p>

<p>“Nina, my trusty maid, shall take this to my lover,”
she thought, “and while she is gone I will tell Margaret
that my troubles are ended.”</p>

<p>She was awakened from a blissful reverie by the return
of her maid, with Margaret Nugent following close behind.</p>

<p>“I declare,” exclaimed Miss Nugent, “it is a positive
relief to find that there is nothing seriously wrong. Nina
was so urgent, so mysterious, that I began to anticipate
all sorts of awful possibilities; and here you are looking
perfectly happy, Lady Elaine.”</p>

<p>Margaret’s dark eyes promptly took in the situation,
as she swept into my lady’s boudoir, while Nina retired
to another room.</p>

<p>“You are right, Margaret; I am happier than I have
been for days and days,” Lady Elaine said. “And it is
really very kind of you to bother with my foolish troubles.
I can never forget your sympathy and kindness.”
Then she told Miss Nugent all, concluding:</p>

<p>“You advised me for the best, but my pride is broken.
I can live no longer without my lover.”</p>

<p>Margaret was almost bewildered by the shock.</p>

<p>“You have astonished me,” she said, at last. “I can
scarcely realize that the proud daughter of a hundred
earls can possibly become so meek. But, then, we are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
forced to acknowledge that man is lord of creation, while
we poor women are crushed into obedience.”</p>

<p>She tried to laugh, but it was a dismal failure.</p>

<p>“Oh, Elaine,” she added, a pang of bitterness at her
heart, “I pity your future!”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” the earl’s daughter replied, softly.
“My faith, my love is too strong.”</p>

<p>Even now she did not for one moment suspect Margaret
Nugent hated her as only a jealous woman can
hate.</p>

<p>“I have written to my lover to come back and forgive
me,” Lady Elaine went on, “and now that I have seen
you, Margaret, my maid shall take my letter to him.”</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Nugent turned away her face to
hide the flash of malevolence that sprang to her eyes.
Then she spoke quickly, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady Elaine, since my advice has not ended happily,
it would be a pleasure, indeed, for me to be the
bearer of the flag of truce to my willful cousin. His ultimate
happiness is one of my dearest wishes, and, though
I have no patience with his moods and freaks, no one
cares more for Sir Harold in a sisterly way than I do.
You will grant me this one favor, please, because I am
beginning to feel that in some way I have been acting
disloyally toward him. Mamma and I have to drive to
Annesley Park after lunch, and I will place your letter
into Sir Harold’s own hands.”</p>

<p>“How can I refuse so kind an offer?” Elaine replied.
“Who so reliable a messenger as you, Margaret? Here
is my letter—-here are the words which will recall my
lover.”</p>

<p>Miss Nugent almost snatched it from her. Then she
laughed a forced laugh, and promised that it should be
given to Sir Harold within two hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>She gave Lady Elaine a Judas kiss, her heart throbbing
with triumph. Then she went away, saying:</p>

<p>“Your lover will be here soon. How happy you look,
Lady Elaine!”</p>

<p>When she was gone the earl’s daughter wandered from
room to room, from house to arbor, wherein she and her
lover had spent so many blissful hours.</p>

<p>As the time sped away her heart pulsed painfully and
dark circles began to form under her eyes.</p>

<p>The sun cast slanting shadows on the grass, then sank
to rest in a cloud of fire. Still Sir Harold did not come.</p>

<p>A young moon mounted the purple sky, and my lady
sought her chamber. The clocks tolled the hours until
the servants closed the windows and doors, and there
was no Sir Harold.</p>

<p>“He will come to-morrow,” Lady Elaine told herself;
“my love will come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But the morrow brought no relief to her tortured soul.
Margaret Nugent came, with pale face and burning eyes.</p>

<p>“I gave Sir Harold your letter,” she said, “but he tore
it to atoms and cast it into my face. He scoffed at you
and your love. Oh, Lady Elaine, you have broken his
heart! He has left Annesley Park forever!”</p>

<p>“Gone! Forever!”</p>

<p>The words struggled through the pale lips of the earl’s
daughter.</p>

<p>“Do I hear you aright—he scoffed at my love; he destroyed
my letter? Just Heaven, help me to bear this
pain!”</p>

<p>She fell prone to the floor, like one stricken with death.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE LETTERS TIED WITH BLUE RIBBON.</p>


<p>Sir Harold Annesley had been in England so short a
time that he had made few friends, and not even these
had any particular claim upon him. He had no reason
to consider them; he had no explanations to make. Was
he of any importance, after all? There would be a ripple
on society’s water when the story was given out that his
engagement to Lady Elaine Seabright was broken; then
all would become calm again. He might be condemned,
but he did not care for that. He would be far away,
where no blame could reach his ears.</p>

<p>When Colonel Greyson had gone he heaved a deep sigh
of relief. The colonel was well-meaning, but he did not
understand. It was impossible for him to understand.</p>

<p>“I have said good-by to my old friend,” thought Sir
Harold, “and I am glad of it. One bitter parting at least
is over, and, in dread of his interference, I will hasten my
movements.”</p>

<p>There was determination in every line of his face, in
every motion of his strong figure.</p>

<p>“No,” he repeated again and again, “the unhappy affair
shall not be patched up by any one. I would rather die
than marry a woman in whom I have not absolute faith
and trust. It is perhaps hard upon Lady Elaine that she
has been misunderstood by me. I have idealized a creature
of clay, and because the veil is torn from my eyes
she must suffer—if she has heart enough to understand!”</p>

<p>The bitter words escaped him in accents of scorn.
Then he held his hands toward heaven and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Merciful God, forgive me, if I am wronging her!
Oh, my darling! my darling!”</p>

<p>The strong man wept, and it seemed to him that his
tears must be tears of blood!</p>

<p>For an hour he scarcely moved. Then he summoned
his valet, who came to him with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“Stimson,” Sir Harold said, “how long have you served
me?”</p>

<p>The valet hardly understood the question, but he answered:</p>

<p>“Nine years, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p>“And you have always been faithful to me and satisfied
with your position?”</p>

<p>“I have no wish to change it,” the valet said. “I would
like to die in your service, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Stimson, I believe you.”</p>

<p>The young baronet paced the floor for a minute, then
he went on:</p>

<p>“I am leaving Annesley Park, Stimson, at once. I do
not know whither I am going. The prospect to any one
but myself cannot be very encouraging, because I have no
intention of ever coming back again.”</p>

<p>The valet was startled.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances,” his master continued, “I
cannot ask you to share my exile, Stimson—I can ask no
one—and I think that I shall be best alone.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you, Sir Harold,” the valet begged.
“I have no friends, no relations, in England; I have no
ties, and I care for nothing, so long as I am with you.”</p>

<p>The baronet was visibly affected.</p>

<p>“I want you to clearly understand,” he said, “that nothing
can change my future plans.”</p>

<p>“I am content, Sir Harold, whatever they may be,” was
the firm reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Then let everything be ready for my departure to
London to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night!” echoed Stimson. “Very well, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p>“You must tell no living soul whither I have gone, and
be prepared to join me to-morrow. I may even change
my name, my very identity. I never wish to be known to
the world as Sir Harold Annesley again. You will deny
me to everybody, Stimson. I have said good-by to Colonel
Greyson. Yes, deny me to everybody except my
cousin, Miss Nugent, if she should wish to see me.
There, Stimson, I have nothing more to say. For an
hour or two I shall be busy with my letters. In the meanwhile
be ready to see me off by the six o’clock train to
London.”</p>

<p>His manner was now calm, almost perfunctory, and
Stimson went about his duties, his mind in a chaos of
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Of course,” thought the valet, regretfully, “a woman
is at the bottom of the trouble. Women always are.
But who would have thought that Lady Elaine could not
agree with Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the baronet indited half-a-dozen business
letters. They were concise and to the point, as such letters
always were with him. Not one betrayed a single
emotion beyond the cold facts they stated.</p>

<p>Then he turned to his desk and opened it, a groan
bursting from his lips.</p>

<p>Among other treasures was a tiny bundle of letters,
held together with a piece of blue ribbon, and in a secret
recess the portrait of a lovely girl.</p>

<p>In the haughty eyes there was the soft light of love;
the firm mouth was curved with love’s tender lines. The
whole face was as beautiful as that of the most idealized
angel. This was Lady Elaine Seabright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Dear God,” Sir Harold groaned, “why should woman
be so fair to lure man’s soul to perdition? Who could
doubt the goodness and purity of the woman who has
made of my life a desolate waste by merely gazing upon
this delusive picture!”</p>

<p>A cry of rage escaped him, and he nearly tore the photograph
in half. Then he bent his face to the table, and
his form shook with convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>“I am only suffering as thousands have suffered—as
thousands of men are suffering now,” he thought. “Can
it be that I am the most despicable coward of them all?
Let me put it from me! Let me be a man, not a pitiful
cur! My heart cries aloud for love and gets a sword-thrust!
What is my duty now? A renunciation of
every happy dream. My life begins anew from this very
day. I have been a lotus-eater; my brain has been steeped
in the opium of self-delusion. I will write an answer to
Lady Elaine. I did not think that my nerves would permit
me to attempt such a thing, but now I feel that this is
one of my first duties. It shall not be said that I went
away without one word, and my lady will be free to love
where she will!”</p>

<p>A cold chill passed from head to foot, his brain reeled;
he felt that to utter such words were almost blasphemy.</p>

<p>He drew writing materials before him and penned the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Broken Idol</span>—I hardly know whether I am writing to a
creature of my dreams, or to one who is possessed of neither
heart nor soul! Oh, Elaine, your last letter has slain every hope
that life held so dear! Better had you pressed to my lips the
poison cup—better to have sheathed a dagger in my heart than
rend it to atoms and leave the body living. I give you your freedom.
I am leaving Annesley Park forever. You will never see
or hear of me again. I shall take particular care of that. Your
bondmaster sets you free! Think of me kindly, if you can—if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
you ever trouble to think of me at all—and believe that I have
none but the most sincere wishes for your future welfare.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Harold Annesley.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“This shall be posted to-morrow,” he decided. “I will
leave it in the hands of Stimson. When she reads it let
me be far away!”</p>

<p>Just then the mournful strains of an old harmonium
fell upon his ears, and he started up in surprise, to find
that a couple of musicians had found their way into the
park, and were playing almost under his window.</p>

<p>He was about to toss them some silver and send them
away, when his eyes fell upon a girl of rare beauty, who
was turning over some music and preparing to sing.</p>

<p>She was attired in the picturesque costume affected by
the peasant class of Italy, and in the rich coils of her
black hair was a bunch of crimson flowers.</p>

<p>Presently she opened her ruby lips and warbled softly:</p>

<p>Sir Harold listened like one who was charmed. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
he opened the window and dropped a gold coin into the
girl’s brown palm.</p>

<p>“Thank you, kind signor!” she said, in perfect English.
“Shall I sing to you again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sing me that song once more. The words appeal
to me strongly, and the air is admirably adapted to your
sweet voice,” cried Sir Harold.</p>

<p>The girl gazed at him wonderingly for a moment; then
a soft light stole into her beautiful, dark eyes, and she
sang to him again, a world of passion in her liquid notes:</p>

    <div class="verse indent3">Before I love such things again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir Harold never forgot those words, and they rang in
his ears, the requiem of all his dead hopes!</p>

<p>“Has the kind signor loved one who is frail?” the girl
whispered, softly.</p>

<p>“Once more sing to me,” was his reply, and the man
at the harmonium played the prelude, glad to have so
generous a patron, though he occasionally cast uneasy
glances toward his daughter.</p>

<p>Sir Harold was rudely awakened from the spell that
the youthful singer had cast about him by the metallic
tones of his cousin, Margaret Nugent, who had entered
the room unobserved.</p>

<p>“My dear Harold,” she was saying. “What is the
meaning of this <i>extempore</i> concert? What a sweet voice
the girl has!”</p>

<p>The baronet turned as the musicians went away, the
girl casting back at him pitying glances from her liquid
black eyes.</p>

<p>“And pretty, too, is she not?” continued Margaret.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
“Why, goodness, Harold! What is wrong with you?
Is it the old story—the first quarrel?”</p>

<p>“Do not jest, Margaret,” Sir Harold groaned. “I
know that, in a measure, you have been Lady Elaine’s
confidante, but I will add to all else that you may know
that everything is at an end between us, and that you
have just arrived here in time to say good-by.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him sympathetically, and replied:</p>

<p>“My poor Harold, I am sorry, but I am not surprised.
Lady Elaine is young and thoughtless. Such love as
yours she does not understand. Must we part with
you?”</p>

<p>In her heart she thought:</p>

<p>“And the sooner he goes the better, lest that meddlesome
Colonel Greyson will take it into his head to come
here again. A few months will suffice to efface her from
his heart, and then——”</p>

<p>“I will not inflict myself upon you now, Harold,” she
went on, “but you will let us know—mamma and me—where
you are going to—how you are progressing? I do
not like this sort of thing, but it is not altogether a surprise
for me. For goodness’ sake, don’t worry yourself
to death! How could I bear that? There is at least
one who cares for you disinterestedly.”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes, conscious that they were burning
with all the passion of her intense nature.</p>

<p>“Yes, Margaret,” Sir Harold said, sadly, “you have
ever been a dear, dear sister to me, and I think that I
esteem you now more than at any other time. I have met
with a severe shock, a disappointment which no words
can describe. I hate my home, my country even, and
shall again become a wanderer in strange lands, until the
edge of my grief is blunted.”</p>

<p>“But you must write to us, Harold”—there was real
pain in her voice—“you must write to us, and I am sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
that you will be glad to come home again to those who
really care for you!”</p>

<p>“Some day I may, Margaret, but it may not be for
years! I leave to-night!”</p>

<p>She wept a little, then pressed his fingers in parting,
and he was grateful for her womanly sympathy.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">SIR HAROLD’S DEPARTURE.</p>


<p>“Here is a letter for you to post, Stimson,” Sir Harold
said, two hours later. “Put it into the box with your
own hands. To-night I am going to London, and you
must join me at the Southwestern Hotel to-morrow afternoon.
I have placed my affairs in the hands of my men
of business, and I want you to feel perfectly satisfied that
you will never regret leaving home, perhaps forever.”</p>

<p>“My home is with you, Sir Harold,” was the fervent
response.</p>

<p>“Tell no one whither I am gone, and when you rejoin
me, be careful that your movements are not watched by
well-meaning friends.”</p>

<p>Stimson gathered a few points of necessary information
regarding the luggage required, and one hour later
Sir Harold left the park, simply attired in ordinary walking
costume and carrying a light cane. To an ordinary
observer he appeared to be going for a stroll. There was
nothing in his manner to indicate that he was a broken
and hopeless man.</p>

<p>Until he reached the end of the avenue, he looked
neither to the right nor to the left. Then he paused and
gazed over the smiling gardens, now aflame with flowers.
The park stood darkly beyond, clothed in its summer
dress, and in the shadow of a thousand murmurous
trees nestled his beautiful home.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” he gasped. “What might have been!
What might have been!”</p>

<p>He believed that he was alone, but his gesture of despair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
had been seen by other eyes—his words of agony
had reached other ears.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a soft footfall, and he turned
to behold the Italian singer.</p>

<p>“Pardon, kind sir,” she said. “I feared that you were
in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Trouble!”</p>

<p>He laughed a low, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>“Trouble, child! Ah, such trouble that never entered
another heart! You wonder in your innocence that I—the
owner of all these broad lands, of yonder noble home—you
wonder what I can know of trouble! For your
simple life, even though you know not from one day to
another how you are to live, God knows how gladly I
would exchange, if the past could be forever blotted
out!”</p>

<p>He turned to continue his way, but spoke again.</p>

<p>“You have not told me your name.”</p>

<p>“Theresa Hamilton,” she said, simply.</p>

<p>“Hamilton!” he replied. “That is not an Italian
name.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. My father is an Englishman. My dear
dead mother was an Italian. My father and I live together
at Tenterden, a village twenty miles away. I only
sing for money when it is hard to obtain the rent for our
pretty cottage. Ah, here comes father! One of the
wheels of his harmonium carriage came off, and he has
been to the village to have it repaired. We are going
home now.” She paused and added in a whisper: “Ah,
kind signor, I hope that you will not be long unhappy!”</p>

<p>The musician came toward them, and seemed a little
surprised that his daughter should be talking to the lord
of this great domain.</p>

<p>He frowned slightly, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Come, Theresa, we must hurry if we are to catch the
train.”</p>

<p>He bowed distantly to Sir Harold, and, having placed
the harmonium in the carriage, he started away, dragging
the instrument after him.</p>

<p>Theresa looked back once, and the baronet found himself
gazing at her, he knew not why.</p>

<p>“Let me do what little good I can with my useless
life,” he thought. “Even such a chance as this may never
occur again.”</p>

<p>He followed the musicians, and drew from his pocket a
handful of coins, but the sharp eyes of John Hamilton
had observed the movement.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me, Sir Harold Annesley,” he said
with dignity. “My child sings for money, and I employ
my poor powers to assist her, when we are driven to do
so by dire necessity, but we do not beg. Pray keep your
money.”</p>

<p>The girl blushed painfully, and the young baronet continued
on his way, a bitter laugh upon his lips. Even
that small pleasure was denied him.</p>

<p>The nearest railway station was called Crayford, and
when he asked for a ticket to London the booking clerk
was startled by his hoarse tones and the strange, gray
pallor of his face.</p>

<p>He had a quarter of an hour to wait, and paced the
platform with quick, restless strides. He dreaded lest
some friend should follow him. He felt that any interference
now would madden him.</p>

<p>At last the bell rang, and he heard the distant scream
of the coming train. There were few people on the platform,
but at the last moment John Hamilton arrived with
his harmonium and his beautiful daughter.</p>

<p>The instrument had to be lifted into the luggage van,
a task that the railway porter did not relish, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
not slow in showing the contempt he felt for traveling
musicians and such like.</p>

<p>The same man subsequently attended upon Sir Harold,
and was surprised to find himself gruffly ordered out of
the way.</p>

<p>The train started, and until he heard a hoarse cry of
“Tenterden, Tenterden!” he had lost count of time and
space. Then he awakened to a momentary interest in
life, for he remembered that the sweet singer told him
that she and her father lived at Tenterden.</p>

<p>He looked from the window and saw that the station
was a mere wooden shanty.</p>

<p>It appeared to be quite deserted now, and the old musician
was struggling to lift his harmonium out of the
luggage van, while the guard swore roundly at him for
wasting the company’s time.</p>

<p>All at once there was a crash, and a cry of anger and
dismay from John Hamilton, mingled with the laughter
of the guard, as the train steamed onward again.</p>

<p>In a moment Sir Harold had grasped the situation.
The harmonium had been precipitated to the platform,
and lay a wreck, while the old musician was alternately
bewailing his misfortune and threatening the railway company.</p>

<p>Burning with pity and indignation, the young baronet
resolved to help the old man in his distress, and, opening
the door of the carriage, sprang lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>No one appeared to have seen his action, and the train
steamed slowly from view round a curve in the line, and
in this simple manner commenced one of the most extraordinary
mysteries of modern times.</p>

<p>When Sir Harold’s feet struck the earth he had not
correctly estimated the speed at which the train was
traveling, and was thrown violently down.</p>

<p>His head struck a large stone, and he lay, dazed and
unconscious.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“THE PAST IS ALL A BLANK.”</p>


<p>It was four weeks before Sir Harold opened his eyes
to the beauty of the summer world.</p>

<p>There was not much wrong with him bodily, but mentally
he was a wreck. His memory had been completely
destroyed.</p>

<p>He gazed wonderingly at his surroundings, and inhaled
the odor of a hundred flowers that ornamented the
table in the humble little room he occupied.</p>

<p>Near to a latticed window sat an old man reading, and
Sir Harold watched him curiously. He never remembered
to have seen him before.</p>

<p>John Hamilton glanced anxiously at his guest.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize me yet, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>“Recognize you? No, sir. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Hamilton. I am the musician whose
daughter sang to you at Annesley Park. Do you not remember
falling from the train?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the baronet. “I think that you must
be mistaken.”</p>

<p>John Hamilton sighed.</p>

<p>“You fell, and hurt your head terribly,” he went on,
“and I have nursed you through a long mental illness. I
did not call in a doctor for several reasons, one of which
is that I once practiced the healing art myself.”</p>

<p>“I remember none of these things,” Sir Harold said;
“I would not even know that my name were Sir Harold
if you did not tell me so. The past is all a blank.”</p>

<p>“This is terrible—terrible!” John Hamilton groaned.</p>

<p>“I do not experience any of your terrors,” laughed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
young man. “What a lovely day! If you will permit
it, doctor, I would like to go out into the sunshine.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir! It may do you much good.”</p>

<p>He gazed anxiously at his guest for a few moments;
then he assisted him to dress, and the light, boyish laughter
of Sir Harold shocked him.</p>

<p>“He is happy now,” he thought, “and perhaps it will be
a blessing to him if he never again awakens to his misery—the
misery that I have heard was driving him from his
home. It was my duty to warn his friends of his whereabouts,
but I dared not do it. I should have brought
ruin upon myself and child.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold nodded brightly to him as he left the room
and strolled into the garden. And such a garden it was—of
blossom and perfume! It seemed to be scented by
many millions of flowers.</p>

<p>As he wandered about he whistled merrily. He did not
dream that he was being watched by loving, anxious eyes.
He knew of nothing but the happy present.</p>

<p>Then John Hamilton called Theresa to him, and bade
her sing the songs in which Sir Harold had been so interested
on that fatal day a month ago.</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” she whispered, “must I?” Her lips
quivered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, sternly. “His memory must be awakened.
He cannot stay here forever.”</p>

<p>She seated herself at the window, while her father
played an accompaniment, and sang in her matchless tones
the scoffing words of Moore:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Sir Harold listened with a smile on his face, and when
the singer had finished he stepped toward the window,
while Theresa watched like one who was fascinated.</p>

<p>“To whom am I indebted for such sweet music?”
asked the young man. Then he paused and bowed gallantly
upon observing the figure of Theresa Hamilton,
who was half-crouching behind her father.</p>

<p>“This is my daughter, sir,” Mr. Hamilton said. “Do
you mean to tell me that you do not remember her?”</p>

<p>Sir Harold smiled.</p>

<p>“If I have ever seen the lady before, the circumstance
has quite escaped me,” he replied. “But I hardly think
that I could forget any one so lovely.”</p>

<p>A low moan of surprise and fear left Theresa’s pale
lips, and her father looked on displeased.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold Annesley,” he said, “I am placed in a
desperate position, and I have none to advise me what is
best to do. I hoped that you would be off my hands in a
few days, and intended demanding that you keep my
identity a secret. I think that you understand what I
say, though your mind regarding all that is past has become
a blank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” replied the young man, his admiring
gaze fixed upon Theresa’s sweet face.</p>

<p>“My child,” observed Hamilton, turning to her, “you
had better leave us.” Then, as she began to move away,
he added: “But, no. It is just as well that you hear.
Sit beside me, Theresa.”</p>

<p>The girl obeyed him, and he went on addressing Sir
Harold.</p>

<p>“I wish you to understand your position, sir. Are you
not aware that you are a wealthy man, a famous man,
whose unaccountable disappearance is the talk of all
England?”</p>

<p>“I am not aware of this,” smiled Sir Harold. “It may
appear to be a terrible thing to you, but I am like a man
who has just dropped into a half-familiar world from
some mystery that he cannot fathom. My faculties are
clear and my health and strength unimpaired. I do not
know why I am famous, and I have no use for wealth.
But tell me all of myself that you know. At present I
am more amused than alarmed by whatever misfortune
may have befallen me.”</p>

<p>Theresa was watching him, pity and love smoldering in
her soft, dark eyes.</p>

<p>“A few weeks since,” Hamilton went on, “I had never
seen or even heard of you. For five years I have lived in
this cottage, a recluse who hates and fears the world beyond.
I see surprise in your face, and I will explain.
By profession I am a doctor, but it is long since I practiced
the healing art until you crossed my path, and
Theresa and I have lived upon the scanty earnings of my
pen. When this has failed me, and we have been pressed
for money, it has been comparatively easy to make up our
deficiencies by playing and singing before the houses of
the wealthy. In this way we came to Annesley Park.
Do you remember?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir; I do not.”</p>

<p>There was not the faintest hesitation in Sir Harold’s
tones.</p>

<p>“Well, my daughter’s singing attracted your attention,”
went on John Hamilton, “and you were free with your
money. You appeared to be in great trouble, and I pitied
you from the bottom of my heart, though I resented your
offer of further money a little later.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” faltered Sir Harold, and Hamilton
smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“You entered the same train with us, and I did not
think of you again until I saw you lying insensible some
thirty yards beyond the platform of Tenterden railway
station.”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” murmured Sir Harold, pressing his
hands to his brow.</p>

<p>A sharp spasm of pain shot through his head, and he
added:</p>

<p>“No, no! I will not try to remember. I feel dazed
and bewildered. I do not wish to remember.”</p>

<p>“My duty was clear,” continued Hamilton. “I ought
to have sent to Annesley Park at once, but I was afraid
for myself—I was afraid for Theresa, because the story
would have got into the papers. I thought that I would
cure you, exact from you a promise of secrecy, and send
you away; but now I know not what to do.”</p>

<p>“What is this fear that you have concerning yourself?”
asked Sir Harold; but he did not press the question when
he met the appealing glance of the old man.</p>

<p>“Some day,” Hamilton whispered in his ear, “I will tell
you. It affects my darling child even more than myself.
Her life, if not mine, is in danger.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes; then the old man
went on:</p>

<p>“When you had been here a little while, Sir Harold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
I read in the papers something of your trouble. I had
not bought a newspaper for years, but I was anxious to
see what they had to say about you—to learn if there
was even a suspicion concerning your whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Yes; go on with this extraordinary story, Mr. Hamilton.
I am interested because it concerns myself, not
that I have any knowledge of one hour of my past.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you everything, and then you shall decide
upon your future course. You were engaged to be married,
Sir Harold, to one of the highest ladies in the land—to
Lady Elaine, the daughter of the Earl of Seabright.”</p>

<p>He looked keenly at the young baronet, and only saw
a puzzled smile, that deepened into one of incredulity.</p>

<p>“I do not remember Lady Elaine,” he observed, “and
to the best of my belief this is the first time that I have
ever heard the lady’s name.”</p>

<p>“You were engaged to her, and the papers say that you
loved her madly, but that you deserted her because you
believed that she was not true to you.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” ejaculated Sir Harold, “this is extraordinary!
Are you quite sure that you are not mistaking
me for some other man?”</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands and tried to think, but
again was afflicted by an agony that was excruciating.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton,” he said, at last, “I cannot recall one
incident—I cannot recall one hour of my past. The accident
which has befallen me may be considered a terrible
one, but at present I cannot be brought to regard it as
such. It does not make me suffer in the least until I
try to use my darkened brains. I cannot doubt one word
of your story, but I have no wish to go back into a world
that will have nothing but pity for me. Some time in the
future I may recover what I have lost, but I have no
desire to do so, for it seems that my life must in some
way have been a failure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Sir Harold,” cried John Hamilton, in dismay, “you
must permit me to take you home! I do not like to hear
you talk in this way. I will tell your story to your
friends without revealing too much of myself, and you
will be cured by some of the great doctors of the day.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” pleaded the young baronet. “I could not
bear to be pitied! Time will heal all things. Do you not
see that I should be held up to ridicule everywhere? A
man who had been jilted—a man who was little better
than an idiot! The idea that I might eventually be adjudged
insane is terrifying! Do you not see the force
of my reasoning? Suppose that I return to Annesley
Park, and specialists are called in to diagnose my case—what
will be the result? I shall be pitied and ridiculed.
I cannot remain in blissful ignorance of this like the ordinary
lunatic, even if the doctors were unsuccessful. My
life would be to me a daily torture. I may even have a
keeper constantly at my elbow, or be shut up altogether
in an asylum for idiots. On the other hand, if I am
cured, my mind will reawaken to much that will be unpleasant,
and the ridicule will be the same. People will
point at me, and say: ‘There goes a man who went mad
because a woman jilted him!’ I could not bear it, and
I am so happy here! No, sir! Let me stay where I am
until the excitement has cooled down. Let me enjoy the
perfect peace of this little paradise until I can face the
world again as Sir Harold Annesley of old!”</p>

<p>Theresa had listened to him with shining eyes, and
now she turned them anxiously, appealingly, toward her
father.</p>

<p>“Shall I be doing right if I accede to this request?”
the old man muttered.</p>

<p>“You have spoken of some reason for the recluse-like
life you are leading,” added Sir Harold; “you have
spoken of some danger that menaces your daughter if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
your identity be discovered. Why should you run the
risk of this? If you object to my presence here, let me
go quietly away elsewhere.”</p>

<p>At that moment he saw the light of adoration in
Theresa’s humid eyes, and he never forgot it.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold,” Mr. Hamilton said, brokenly, “you shall
please yourself. You shall do just as you wish—all but
one thing. I cannot part with you; I dare not let you
go away until God lifts the cloud that has blotted out
your past. We are poor—miserably poor—but you will
not miss the luxuries of life now, and it may be that soon,
very soon, you will awaken to the full knowledge of all
that you have lost. At least, we will hope for the best.
We will wait for a while, and then——”</p>

<p>But Sir Harold interrupted him with words of thanks,
saying:</p>

<p>“Enough, sir; I am quite satisfied. You have told me
sufficient to convince me that my past, whatever it may
be, is linked with the perfidy of some woman—that it is
one of misery. The present is one of perfect joy! I shall
not be a burden upon you. I have money in my pocketbook
amounting to hundreds of pounds. I will stay until
I can return to the world a rational being, and it will be
amusing to read the papers about myself—to see how a
man is valued after he is thought to be dead.”</p>

<p>He laughed a little, and while Mr. Hamilton grasped
his hand in token of acquiescence, Theresa glided swiftly
from the room to hide her joy.</p>

<p class="center">“I SHALL WAIT, IF NEED BE, FOREVER.”</p>


<p>The mysterious, unaccountable disappearance of Sir
Harold Annesley was the talk of all England.</p>

<p>In some way, the quarrel between himself and Lady
Elaine Seabright had got into the papers. First, it was
published in a society journal; then it went the whole
round of the press.</p>

<p>This is the way in which the public received the news:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Romance Outdone.</span>—It now transpires that the quixotic young
baronet, who has provided society with a new nine days’ wonder,
has violently quarreled with his <i>fiancée</i>, the Lady Elaine Seabright.
My lady discovered at a very early stage of their love-making
that Sir Harold was periodically attacked with insane
jealousy. The theory of Stimson, the valet, that his master has
met with foul play is absurd, simply because he got rid of Mr.
Stimson by a sly trick. No, Sir Harold merely left England under
an assumed name, and is no doubt quietly enjoying the sensation
he has created. At any rate, he is teaching his capricious
ladylove a lesson which she may not readily forget.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Greyson read this with bristling mustache and
a face purple with anger.</p>

<p>He showed it to Margaret Nugent, little dreaming that
the cruel story had emanated from her. Then he rode
over to Seabright Hall, and found that a marked copy of
the paper had been sent to Lady Elaine.</p>

<p>This was his first visit since he had appealed to her on
behalf of her lover. He had started on his journey with
fierce resentment in his heart, but at sight of Elaine’s
white face his anger turned to tender pity.</p>

<p>The earl was disgusted with the whole affair. He
pretended that he could not understand it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Egad, sir,” he said, “if Sir Harold has gone away deliberately,
leaving my daughter to be made a laughing
stock of, I say that he is worse than a scoundrel; he is
a coward! For my part, I never wish to see or hear of
him again. She can have her pick among a score of better
men, and is a fool to give him another thought. I’ll call
him out, by Jove!”</p>

<p>“I have not come here to defend him,” replied Colonel
Greyson; “but Sir Harold Annesley is neither a scoundrel
nor a coward. There is some mystery about the affair
that is quite beyond me. He made all arrangements for
his valet to meet him in London. He left Crayford by
the six o’clock train on the evening preceding, and has
never been seen or heard of since.”</p>

<p>“Disguised himself!” sneered the earl. “He is so used
to newspaper sensation that he must have it at any cost.”</p>

<p>The colonel glared at him angrily, but went on:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe one word of it. I know the boy too
well. I have had a clever detective at work for a week,
and we have not advanced one step. He made several
appointments in London, not one of which he kept. He
was perfectly sane when he went away, and quietly
wished his cousin, Miss Nugent, good-by. He went
away under the impression that Lady Elaine did not really
care for him; but I will swear that he never contemplated
this miserable scandal. His final wishes were that he
should bear whatever blame was attached to the——”</p>

<p>The earl interrupted him with a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>“It is of no use, my dear Greyson,” he said; “your defense
only makes his actions appear the more contemptible.
For some reason, he wished to break the engagement
between himself and Lady Elaine, and adopted this
course for the sake of the theatrical effect. He will turn
up again from Timbuctoo or some other outlandish place,
by and by, for the sole purpose of creating another sensation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
but he may get far more than he expects. For my
part, I wash my hands of the affair, and shall insist upon
Lady Elaine accepting Viscount Rivington.”</p>

<p>The earl spoke decidedly, and Colonel Greyson had little
to say. What argument could he offer? None, until
the mystery surrounding Sir Harold’s movements was
cleared up.</p>

<p>He did not tell the earl that his visit was to Lady
Elaine, and when she did not appear at the dinner-table
he became anxious.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he observed, “that your daughter is not ill,
my lord?”</p>

<p>“She is pretending to be,” was the rejoinder. “Of
course, this farce must be kept up for a time. I hope
you will not stuff any nonsense into her head, colonel.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that she is ill,” he thought, “though
I would not be surprised to find the child of such a
father perfectly heartless.”</p>

<p>He began to give up all hope of seeing Lady Elaine as
the evening advanced and she did not appear. The earl
was not particularly cordial, and he had no pretense for
prolonging his stay.</p>

<p>Luckily, he encountered my lady’s maid in one of the
passages, just when he was fuming savagely, and bade
her tell her mistress that he desired a few words with her.</p>

<p>“That is,” he added, a little considerately, “if she is
well enough to see me. I will wait in the west drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine came much sooner than he had expected,
a world of anxiety and suffering in her face.</p>

<p>He stepped forward swiftly and took one of her hands
between his, thinking, “Poor child! How I have misjudged
her!”</p>

<p>“I did not know that you were here, Colonel Greyson,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Lady Elaine said, faintly. She sat down and looked at
him pleadingly.</p>

<p>“You have no news for me?”</p>

<p>“None,” he replied, sadly. “I came here to-day to see
if you—if you cared at all.”</p>

<p>“If I cared!” she echoed. “Do you not see that my
heart is breaking; that this horrible suspense will kill me?
The papers are full of cruel things, and if I have sent my
darling to his death, I have no further wish to live.”</p>

<p>“The papers?” he questioned, and then his eyes blazed
with anger when she took from her pocket a marked copy
of the society journal which had tried to make scandal
out of her misery.</p>

<p>“Whose hand is in this?” he muttered. “By Heaven,
if I only knew! Toss the thing into the fire!” he added,
aloud. “It is not worthy of a moment’s thought, Elaine.
Child, be of good cheer. I am leaving no stone unturned.
There is foul play somewhere. You promised me that
you would send to him. Why did you delay?”</p>

<p>“I did not,” was the piteous rejoinder. “Has not Margaret
told you? He scoffed at my love; he tore my letter
to fragments and threw it away. Afterward he wrote
cruel things to me. But he will come back again, if he
lives. I know that he will, and I shall wait, if need be,
forever.”</p>

<p>She looked at him in a way that he never forgot.</p>

<p>“I have misjudged you, Lady Elaine,” he said. “I did
not think you were capable of such love as this.”</p>

<p>He looked at her pityingly, then his brow became dark.</p>

<p>“Why did Margaret Nugent not tell me of the letter?”
he thought. “This puts the matter in a new light. This
inclines me to believe that the earl’s theory is the correct
one, and yet how could that boy be guilty of such meanness?
He must have been mad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>He promised Lady Elaine some news at an early date,
but nothing came of his investigations.</p>

<p>A small fortune was spent upon detectives and advertisements
in papers all over the world, but not an atom
of information was to be obtained anywhere. A hundred
messages were flashed across the Atlantic, and many
harmless, innocent men were made objects of suspicion,
but it all ended in—nothing.</p>

<p>The sum total was this: Sir Harold Annesley had been
seen to enter a train at Crayford Station, and there he
disappeared completely.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">AT LADY GAYNOR’S BALL.</p>


<p>A month had passed, and the world was beginning to
forget that such a person as Sir Harold Annesley had
ever existed.</p>

<p>His man of business had closed the park, and dismissed
half the servants, and it was the general belief that the eccentric
young baronet was masquerading abroad. His
actions had been strongly condemned; and many leaders
of fashion decided to close their doors to him when he did
return home again.</p>

<p>“This wearing of the willow must end,” the Earl of
Seabright said to his daughter one morning. “Where is
your pride, Elaine? Do you not see that you are an object
of pity among the servants and one of contempt
among your equals?”</p>

<p>“I do not care for either pity or contempt, papa,” she
replied, listlessly.</p>

<p>“But I do!” was the angry retort.</p>

<p>“I do not see how it can affect you, papa.”</p>

<p>“You do not see!” he cried, in surprise. “Great
Heavens, are you bereft of common sense? What man
will care to marry a woman who is fretting after a lover
who shamelessly jilted her?”</p>

<p>“My lover will come back to me,” replied Elaine. “I
can marry no other man.”</p>

<p>“Where is your self-respect?” he demanded, furiously.
“Your lover will never come back to you! Can you not
see through his shallow trick? At least, you must appear
in society. I will not have this moping away in dark
rooms. Here is an invitation to Lady Gaynor’s ball. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
must be there, if only to end the silly gossip about broken
hearts. Pshaw, I have no sympathy with such nonsense!”</p>

<p>“If it is your desire, papa, I will accept the invitation,”
Lady Elaine said, calmly; “but I shall find no pleasure
at Lady Gaynor’s ball.”</p>

<p>The earl was satisfied that he had gained his point so
far.</p>

<p>“She will soon forget the fellow in the excitement of
pleasure. If necessary, I will take her abroad,” he
thought.</p>

<p>Two days later Miss Nugent came and kissed Lady
Elaine with a great show of affection.</p>

<p>The one subject was the ball and the dresses they were
to wear. Lady Elaine treated the whole thing in a listless,
apathetic manner.</p>

<p>“I have no special choice,” she said; “I shall leave the
selection to my maid. I have no one to please.”</p>

<p>“My dear Elaine, how ridiculous you are,” exclaimed
Margaret Nugent. “You know that the viscount adores
you.”</p>

<p>“Silence!” the earl’s daughter said, sternly. “How can
you speak in that way—you, who know all?”</p>

<p>“It is that very knowledge that makes me speak,” Miss
Nugent replied, steadily. “It is that very knowledge that
makes me speak, Lady Elaine. You are wasting your life
for a man who never cared for you. He confessed to me
that it was merely the infatuation of a moment. I dared
not tell you so before. These creatures of poetic fancy
are never to be trusted wholly. Sir Harold has ever been
eccentric and quixotic; he has ever been afflicted with
some new craze at which hard-hearted, sober-minded men
have smiled. I believe that for a little while he worshiped
you as the perfect embodiment of some cherished ideal;
but the instant he realized that you were only human, his
so-called love changed to actual dislike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Lady Elaine had become deadly pale.</p>

<p>“And do you expect me to listen to you, Margaret
Nugent—to believe you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Before Heaven, I swear that I am telling you simple
truth, Lady Elaine! My cousin never really loved you as
men are supposed to love women, and soon regretted the
tangle he had woven about himself. To escape it, he
stooped to trickery and dishonor. I alone am in his confidence.
I alone know where he is wandering again. I
have had a letter from him this very day. Even if you
hate me for it, it is my duty to tell you the truth.”</p>

<p>“Heaven help me!” moaned Elaine. “I have given him
my love—the love of my life—and I can never change!
I worship the king of my dreams, not the wretched creature
of clay that he has proved himself to be! And, now
that I know the worst, I will school myself to wear a
smile, though my heart is broken!”</p>

<p>It never occurred to her to doubt Miss Nugent’s words.
Margaret had always been her friend, and there was no
earthly reason why she should deceive her. Besides,
everything pointed to the truth of the statement, and the
mystery about Sir Harold was partly cleared away.</p>

<p>At Lady Gaynor’s ball she appeared to be one of the
gayest of the gay, and my lord of Seabright was delighted.</p>

<p>“She has sense and pride, after all,” he thought. “Being
a Seabright, it could not well be otherwise.”</p>

<p>She danced with several eligible men, but Viscount
Rivington was the most favored of all, and his eyes burnt
with triumph.</p>

<p>“The earl has told me to go in for rapid conquest,” he
thought. “Hearts are easily caught in the rebound.”</p>

<p>He led Lady Elaine from the heated ballroom, and,
seated in a conservatory, they listened to the singing of
one of the lady guests:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Beautiful words,” Lady Elaine murmured, dreamily,
“and beautifully rendered!”</p>

<p>Viscount Rivington only dimly comprehended her remark.
His whole being was on fire with love.</p>

<p>He made no reply, but snatched her to him in a frenzy
of passion.</p>

<p>For a moment Lady Elaine was so overcome with astonishment
that she could make no resistance. His action
had been so unexpected, so sudden, that she felt herself
clasped in his arms before she realized what had happened.
Brief as the scene was, it had not escaped the
watchful eyes of Margaret Nugent, and she retired with
the feelings of a victor.</p>

<p>She encountered the Earl of Seabright a dozen steps
away, and he looked about him eagerly.</p>

<p>“Miss Nugent, have you seen Lady Elaine?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” she smiled. “I would not advise you
to interrupt a very interesting <i>tête-à-tête</i>.”</p>

<p>He grasped one of her wrists and looked straight into
her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Is Viscount Rivington with my daughter?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I have just seen Lady Elaine in the viscount’s arms,”
replied Miss Nugent, with a light laugh. “Not very flattering
to my absent cousin, but girls’ hearts are not made
to break.”</p>

<p>The earl was delighted, and the two went away, Miss
Nugent to impart the news to an aristocratic scandalmonger,
who added to her income by writing sensational
paragraphs for a certain unscrupulous society paper, and
the earl to excuse Lady Elaine’s absence to Colonel Greyson,
who had only recently arrived, and had made an
inquiry for her.</p>

<p>“My dear colonel,” he said, “I am sorry to disappoint
you, but I do not think that my daughter would welcome
your presence just now.”</p>

<p>“I am of a different opinion,” Colonel Greyson said,
stoutly. “You and I, my lord, will never agree upon one
point. What that is you know only too well.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to discuss the matter,” the earl replied,
“and I do not thank you for interfering in what is
purely a family matter. As I told you recently, I never
wish to hear the name of Sir Harold Annesley again.
My dear colonel, if Lady Gaynor knew that you had followed
me here to-night, of all nights, for the express purpose
of annoying me, you would incur her severe displeasure.”</p>

<p>“I have brought news for Lady Elaine,” the colonel
said. “I have no wish to annoy you, Lord Seabright, or
any of Lady Gaynor’s guests. I bring hope to a breaking
heart, and I intend seeing your daughter before I leave
to-night.”</p>

<p>The earl laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“You must see her, certainly, if you are determined to
do so; but I warn you that Lady Elaine does not wish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
see you or hear from you again. In brief, she has this
very day accepted Viscount Rivington for her future
husband.”</p>

<p>The colonel’s face became fiery red, but further words
were checked by the appearance of Margaret Nugent.</p>

<p>“Miss Nugent will verify my statement,” the earl said,
carelessly. “As the affianced wife of Viscount Rivington,
my daughter cannot wish to be bothered by news of a
recreant lover. It is very bad taste upon your part, colonel,
to make yourself a meddlesome busybody.”</p>

<p>He turned coldly and walked away.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” asked Colonel Greyson, turning to Miss
Nugent.</p>

<p>“It is,” she replied, pale to the lips. “I myself witnessed
the viscount’s declaration; I saw her ladyship in
his arms.”</p>

<p>“Then my faith in woman’s constancy is forever shattered,”
he said. “Good-by, Margaret. It is perhaps better
that he should never know.”</p>

<p>“He? To whom do you refer?”</p>

<p>“To Sir Harold. My detective has found him. He is
well in health, but for the present his mind is a wreck.
I came here like a happy schoolboy, and go away the
most miserable and disappointed of men. I would have
staked my life on the constancy of Lady Elaine Seabright.”</p>

<p>Miss Nugent was painfully agitated. There was an
unnatural fire in her eyes.</p>

<p>“So my cousin is back!” she whispered, her whole
frame quivering with excitement. “You must come and
see us to-morrow, colonel; my mother and I will be glad
to see you. It is best for you not to remain here longer.
I can understand the shock of your disappointment, but
your pity for the earl’s daughter is wasted. I have always
known this. You men cannot divine the depth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
our sex as a woman can. Lady Elaine is tender and loving,
but her character lacks strength. Knowing Sir Harold
as I do, the escape from this marriage is a most fortunate
thing for him, for he would have found out, sooner
or later, that his wife was little better than a doll. You
wonder that I should speak so strongly? I cannot help
it when I realize how quickly and easily my poor cousin
has been forgotten by the woman who may have ruined
his whole life. The earl’s daughter and I have had bitter
words this very evening. I do not think that we can ever
be friendly again. She told me calmly of her engagement
to Viscount Rivington, and at the same time was
wearing the ring that Sir Harold gave her. She spoke
of him so lightly that I became angry, and both have
uttered things that may never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>She accompanied him to the door, fearful lest anything
might happen even now to turn the tide against her. She
longed to ask him questions concerning her cousin, but
dared not.</p>

<p>As they paused for a moment in the hall, he saw Lady
Elaine and Viscount Rivington enter the ballroom from
another doorway. What further proof did he require that
all he had heard was indeed true?</p>

<p>“Good-by, Margaret,” he said. “You shall hear the
whole pitiful story in a day or two. Sir Harold is in no
danger, but his mind concerning the past is blank. He
does not know even me. He does not remember Lady
Elaine, and now I believe it is better so. I have been
cherishing some pet schemes for trying to restore his
memory, but now all is over.”</p>

<p>He went away, cursing at the frailty of women, and
Miss Nugent thanked Heaven when he was gone.</p>

<p>“It is hard to believe,” she thought, “that Elaine would
so soon succumb to the pleadings of the viscount, but did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
I not see her clasped to his bosom with my own eyes? I
must find out what it all means.”</p>

<p>Had she waited one moment longer, when she was spying
upon the viscount and Lady Elaine, how different
would her feelings have been!</p>

<p>Recovering from her astonished bewilderment, Elaine
had pushed her suitor indignantly aside, a flash of loathing
and disgust in her eyes.</p>

<p>“How dare you?” she panted. “How dare you take advantage
of me in so cowardly a manner? I hate and
despise you for it!”</p>

<p>Rivington fell back aghast. He had not expected this.
In his first flush of triumph he believed that she accepted
his embraces willingly.</p>

<p>“Lady Elaine,” he said, “what harm have I done you?
I offer you the fond love of an honest heart. I have
never loved any woman but you, and fancied that the
reward of my patience and hope was at hand. Forgive
me if I have been mistaken.”</p>

<p>He spoke so penitently that she felt sorry for her harsh
words.</p>

<p>“Viscount, I thought that it was a settled thing between
us that I have no love to give any man now,” she
said, sorrowfully. “I shall never marry, and this talk of
love cuts me to the soul! If you value my friendship,
you will never hint at love again. My heart is dead to
all other but the love that is past.”</p>

<p>He knew not what to say to this, and paced the floor
in angry disappointment.</p>

<p>“I cannot live without you, Lady Elaine!” he said, at
last. “I have loved you for two years. I can wait for
years longer if you will but give me one spark of hope.”</p>

<p>She shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>“You will forget what is gone,” he went on, desperately.
“Time will heal the wound——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“You must not continue in this strain,” she interrupted,
sadly but firmly, “if we are to be friends. I can give you
no hope, Viscount Rivington. Even if I had never met
my lover, who is dead, I could not have cared for you—only
as a—a friend—as my father’s guest. I can never
love again, and once more I warn you that if you do not
put this vain and useless desire away from you I will not
speak to you or recognize you any more.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head in silence. In his heart he was a
raging demon. He told himself that he would never give
her up.</p>

<p>They passed through the ballroom together, and my
Lord of Seabright watched them with glances of approval.</p>

<p>Lady Elaine escaped to her apartments and retired for
the night, while Viscount Rivington and Margaret Nugent
conversed in the open air.</p>

<p>Two days later the following announcement appeared
in a society paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have pleasure in being able to inform our readers that the
famous beauty, Lady Elaine Seabright, and Viscount Henry Rivington
have become engaged. The match is suitable in every
way, and gives unbounded satisfaction to both families. It will
be remembered that the Earl of Seabright’s beautiful daughter
was to have been married to Sir Harold Annesley, of Annesley
Park, who recently disappeared in so mysterious a manner. Poor
fellow! He is gone! <i>N’importe!</i> Off with the old love and on
with the new. Such is life! We offer the happy couple our sincere
congratulations.</p>

<p class="center">MY PLACE IS HERE TO PROTECT THERESA.</p>


<p>John Hamilton’s cottage was one of the prettiest of its
kind. It was built of brown stone, and seemed to be a
combination of nooks and gables. To the doors, both
at the back and the front, there was a trellised porch,
wreathed with trailing vines, roses and sweet-smelling
clematis. On every window-sill there was a box of
bright-hued flowers and fragrant mignonette, while the
garden that surrounded the house was a veritable maze
of bewildering beauty.</p>

<p>At the farther end was a summer arbor, and there Sir
Harold spent many happy hours, a cigar between his
teeth and a book in his hands.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would dream lazily, and try to think of
the mystery of his life, but always gave up these efforts
with a sigh.</p>

<p>John Hamilton and his daughter attended to the household
duties, and the labor was equally divided. No
stranger ever crossed the threshold of the little cottage
door.</p>

<p>Sir Harold would watch the girl in wonderment, and
listen with rapture to her sweet singing as she worked
about the house.</p>

<p>Oh, how happy she was, though at times a great black
cloud would rise before her, and she would clutch at her
heart to still its agony!</p>

<p>When her work was done, her sweetest delight was to
sit near to Sir Harold, and drink in eagerly every word
that he uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>John Hamilton saw all this, and frowned, but he felt
that he was helpless at present.</p>

<p>One day he spoke harshly to his daughter, and she
listened half-ashamed.</p>

<p>“Theresa,” he said, “you must not seek the society of
our guest so much, or I shall send him away.”</p>

<p>The girl started, and a swift blush leaped into her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>“Do you not understand that your conduct is unbecoming
a lady?” he continued.</p>

<p>“What have I done?” murmured Theresa.</p>

<p>“You are wasting your thoughts upon a stranger, my
dear,” he said. “I can see it in your eyes. You are not
so much to blame for this, because you are purely a child
of Nature, but it will be best if Sir Harold Annesley is
left more to himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, must this be?” cried Theresa. “Must I
not speak to him again? Must I not listen to his reading
while I work? It is like heaven to me! I never understood
the meaning of life until he came here!”</p>

<p>She rocked herself to and fro bitterly.</p>

<p>“I wish that he had never crossed our path,” he returned,
harshly. “You are in love with this man!”</p>

<p>He was very angry—as much with himself and Sir
Harold as with his daughter—and left the room determined
to speak to the baronet.</p>

<p>He found him in the summer arbor, reading and smoking
as usual, the happy light of contentment in his blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“Where is Theresa?” he asked. “I have been reading
Tennyson’s ‘Maud,’ and I want Theresa to hear it. Much
of the beautiful poem seems to be but an echo. I feel
that I have known these lines before:</p>

<p>He paused to turn over another page, and Mr. Hamilton
spoke:</p>

<p>“Sir Harold, this is sufficient evidence to convince me
that you cannot—must not remain here longer. Your
place is in the great world beyond.”</p>

<p>“I am quite happy,” the young baronet replied. “You
promised that I should suit my own inclinations.”</p>

<p>“Then I must withdraw that promise. Circumstances
have arisen that render it imperative.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold dropped his cigar, and looked at Mr. Hamilton
in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“What is wrong, my friend?” he demanded. “If there
are pecuniary troubles, it will not be difficult to obtain
money upon the valuables I have about me.”</p>

<p>John Hamilton made a deprecatory movement, and sat
down opposite his guest.</p>

<p>“It is not that, Sir Harold,” he said. “I wish you to
leave my humble home for the sake of my dear child.
She is young, impressionable, imaginative. She has never
been used to the society of young men. She knows nothing
of the world. This poetry reading has influenced her
young mind, and the most gallant of the old-world
knights pale into insignificance when compared with you
in her estimation. In short, Sir Harold, she is in love
with you, as romantic girls will be with handsome young
men.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold was surprised. “I had never dreamed of
this,” he said. “Poor Theresa!”</p>

<p>“Do not pity her; I cannot bear it, but go—go!”</p>

<p>“Why should I leave her to unhappiness?” Sir Harold
mused. “I love her as a very dear sister. I have never
cared for woman in any other way, and Theresa has first
claim upon me. Mr. Hamilton,” he added aloud, “why
should I throw away the priceless gift of Theresa’s love?”</p>

<p>“You are mad!” was the rejoinder. “You know not
what you say. This thing cannot be!”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Your memory will return, and your heart go back to
its old love.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so. Whoever the woman may be, you
say that she was false to me. That is quite sufficient to
kill my love forever.”</p>

<p>John Hamilton pressed his hands to his head to still his
reeling brain.</p>

<p>“I know not what to say,” he whispered, huskily. “Just
Heaven, guide me aright! Let me not make shipwreck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of my child’s life! You tempt me sorely, Sir Harold, for
I know not what will become of her when I am dead, and
I am far from being strong! At times my heart pains me
so that the fear of sudden death fills me with terror for
my dear child’s sake. I know the symptoms only too well.
Some day, aye, at any hour—the knife of the assassin
may be turned against her, and if I am gone, who is to
protect her then?”</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute, then went on: “I owe
you a story, Sir Harold. I promised weeks ago to tell
you why I lived in this secluded place, and held no communication
with the world beyond. I am old now, and
poor, with no hope for rest this side the grave. At thirty
I was a successful man, with a brilliant future before me.
The whole world was my battlefield, and I gathered fresh
laurels wherever I went. At last my surgical skill attracted
the attention of a Russian prince, who had for
years been suffering with a malformation which made
of him an object of pity. He offered me an enormous fee
to operate upon him; he cared not what pain he endured;
he cared not whether he lived or died unless he could
mingle with his fellows, and enjoy the sweets of life. I
was warned by the cleverest physicians of the day that
the task was hopeless; but, fired with the enthusiasm of
youth, I shook off all restraint; I turned a deaf ear to all
counsel, and went to St. Petersburg. I will not weary
you with a description of my anxiety—of the weeks of
patient waiting while my charge lingered between life and
death after the operation. Let it suffice that I was successful;
my name rang through Europe, and fame and
fortune met me at every turn.”</p>

<p>His pale cheeks flushed, and his eyes brightened with
the recollections of those bygone days.</p>

<p>“A few months afterward I was tempted to go to Italy
by the promise of an unusually large fee if I could remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
a tumor from the cheek of a wealthy old count.
As usual, I was careful to receive correct reports concerning
the condition of my would-be patient, and I heard
that no power on earth could save his life. Already had
he been twice operated upon.</p>

<p>“This news fired me with determination, and I accepted
the onerous task.</p>

<p>“It was a foolish decision on my part, for now I could
not afford to make a mistake, or the fame that had so suddenly
encircled me would fall in ruins at my feet.</p>

<p>“One glance at the sufferer convinced me that the days
of Count Crispi were numbered—whether he was operated
on or not. The taint of the tumor was in every
artery of his shriveled frame.</p>

<p>“‘It is of no use adding fresh torture to the brief span
of your life,’ I told him. ‘You have less than a month
to live in any case.’</p>

<p>“‘You lie!’ he said, fiercely. ‘I will live—I must live!
You think that I am old, and that the fire has forever
left my veins! Ha! you cold Northerners know nothing
of the passions of the children of the South! I tell
you that I will live, for the sake of one whom I adore—one
who is to be my wife. She is youthful—she is beautiful!
<i>Carissima mia!</i>’</p>

<p>“I was startled into a feeling of pity and contempt. It
seemed absurd for so old a man, on the verge of eternity,
going into raptures of this kind.</p>

<p>“‘If you insist, Count Crispi, I suppose that, as I have
accepted the commission and your fee, I must do my best,
but I warn you that it will be needless infliction of pain
and disappointment upon you.’</p>

<p>“But no words of mine could dissipate the strong belief
that he cherished in the certainty of his speedy recovery,
and I began to make arrangements for the operation,
which I decided should be conducted in two days’ time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“In the meanwhile, however, I was careful to inform
all those friends who were immediately concerned in his
welfare that his death, which was certainly near at hand,
would possibly be accelerated by the needless butchery.
Among these friends I made the acquaintance of the
young girl whom he professed to love so violently, and I
must confess that I was almost bewildered by her brilliant
beauty.”</p>

<p>John Hamilton paused, and Sir Harold saw that he was
momentarily overcome by the emotions which were raised
by this recital of the story from the shadowy past.</p>

<p>“Let me continue,” Mr. Hamilton said, hastily brushing
a tear from his cheek. “Sir Harold, I soon discovered
that this beautiful, guileless creature was Count Crispi’s
wealthy ward, and that, while she feared the man, she
also loathed him. In my pity for Theresa Ludovci, I
soon drifted into a passion that seemed to consume me.
I loved her as strong men love but once in a lifetime, and
she returned my adoration only as such burning natures
can.</p>

<p>“At all risks, I determined that she should be my wife,
and within two weeks of the count’s operation we fled,
and a priest made us one.</p>

<p>“When the story reached the ears of Count Crispi, his
rage was so great that he fell back with blood-flecked
lips, and with his last breath denounced me as an assassin.
I had deliberately planned his death, so that an obstacle
might be removed which threatened the disruption of my
connubial pleasures.</p>

<p>“His relatives, who had counted upon being the ultimate
recipients of a goodly share of Theresa’s wealth,
registered an oath of vengeance, and a vendetta began,
under the awful ban of which my beloved wife died, two
weeks after the birth of our daughter—Theresa.</p>

<p>“For a time I struggled against the terrible fear—fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
only for my little child—until some poor fellow who had
the misfortune to resemble me was stabbed to death in
the streets of London. My name and that of Count Crispi
were attached to the handle of the murderer, and I knew
its meaning! The newspapers made a great fuss of the
mysterious tragedy, and I changed my name and sought
retirement.”</p>

<p>“Then your name is not Hamilton?” asked the baronet,
greatly interested.</p>

<p>“No; it is Egerton—Lambert Egerton. I even start
when I utter it myself. Not one word of this story does
my poor Theresa know—not even her real name; and
thus have I lived for fifteen years, my waking and sleeping
hours never free from the shadow of the knife! My
own little fortune has long since gone, and my wife’s
money I have not dared to claim.”</p>

<p>“It is infamous!” Sir Harold said, when Hamilton had
concluded. “I utterly refuse to leave you now, sir; I
should be an ungrateful coward if I did. My place is
here to protect Theresa—to make the poor child happy
if I can.”</p>

<p>“I will not give my consent yet,” Hamilton replied, distressfully,
“and yet, why should I stand in the light of
all that is near and dear to me? Not yet—not yet,” he
added, “it would not be fair to you, Sir Harold. Your
mind is not clear, and you do not rightly estimate the
burden you would take upon yourself. Oh, my poor
Theresa!”</p>

<p>He clutched at his side, his face becoming pale and
clammy with the dews of excruciating pain.</p>

<p>“My old trouble,” he whispered to Sir Harold, who
was anxiously bending over him. “There, it is gone. I
am always bothered in this way if I become agitated.
One word more; try and avoid my daughter for a little
while, until both have had time for calm reflection. If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
have rightly diagnosed your case, your memory will return
by easy stages. Some of the brain cells are merely
paralyzed, and in time will recover their action. You
may then turn with disgust from your present surroundings
and the thoughts that now——”</p>

<p>“My friend—my good friend,” Sir Harold interrupted,
“what you say is impossible. I accept from you the sacred
trust of devoting my life to Theresa. I care for her
deeply, and will protect her with my life, if need be. As
for my memory, let me confess to you that many years of
my early life are now as clear as noonday; but at that
point where I left Eton for Cambridge all becomes enshrouded
in an impenetrable mist.”</p>

<p>“Ah! why did you not tell me this before?” Hamilton
said, betraying much excitement.</p>

<p>“Cannot you guess? I did not tell you lest you should
wish to send me away. I distinctly remember my boyhood’s
friends—my cousin Margaret—my beautiful home
at Crayford—and in spirit I am but seventeen years old.
There is nothing peculiar about the sensation, but I have
no wish to return home until the threads of the remaining
years are gathered together, though I am naturally
curious to know that my business affairs are being carefully
attended to. I am even wishing to look upon the
woman who wrought such havoc in my life, though I
have nothing but contempt for her and for myself.”</p>

<p>He laughed lightly, and Hamilton said:</p>

<p>“This is just what I expected, Sir Harold. You spoke
of a cousin Margaret a moment or two ago. Would you
not like to send for her?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the energetic reply; “I only remember her
as a child of twelve years old. She must be a woman
now. No, I do not wish to see her or any one else until
my mind has regained its normal state. I prefer things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
as they are. I am perfectly content, and while Theresa
is near, this little home is paradise!”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait,” said Mr. Hamilton. “I will not give
my consent yet.”</p>

<p>“Hark! Theresa is coming!” Sir Harold exclaimed.
“I hear her voice in the garden.”</p>

<p>He turned and ran to meet her like a happy schoolboy.</p>

<p class="center">COLONEL GREYSON’S VISIT.</p>


<p>That very day Mr. Hamilton had an unexpected visitor,
and he knew at once that the friends of Sir Harold
had discovered his retreat.</p>

<p>He met the intruder at the garden gate, and Colonel
Greyson (for it was he) regarded him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” Hamilton said.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” was the gruff rejoinder. “You have
a gentleman staying here, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Sir Harold Annesley is here. Do you wish
to see him?”</p>

<p>“One moment, my friend. A detective has traced him.
I trust that you have not detained him against his will?”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, sir, I cannot persuade him to
leave,” replied Hamilton, with dignity.</p>

<p>“I have heard that he met with an accident that paralyzed
his memory. No matter how I obtained the information—there
is the substance of it. Now answer me
truthfully, Mr.—Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Hamilton,” was the calm reply, although the old musician
strongly resented the brusque, condemnatory manner
of his interlocutor. “Your information is perfectly
correct. May I ask, sir, who and what you are?”</p>

<p>The colonel bent upon him a ferocious glance.</p>

<p>“I? My name is Greyson—Colonel Greyson. I have
known Sir Harold since he was a mere boy of twenty.
I succeeded to the co-trusteeship of his business and social
welfare when his natural guardian died. I have
traced him here, and will be responsible for him, while
I may have to hold you responsible for his detention!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“I am prepared to meet any reasonable question you
may think fit to put to me,” was the haughty reply; “but
I object to this bluster.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not send for his friends? Why has he
not received proper medical treatment?”</p>

<p>“I have valid reasons for my actions, however neglectful
they may seem to you. Sir Harold has been in good
hands,” Hamilton said. “Will you follow me, sir?”</p>

<p>“Wait!” the colonel commanded. “I have not quite
done with you, Mr. Hamilton. Never let it be said that
I condemn a man unheard, and if you are as innocent as
you strive to appear, you will not be afraid to answer
one or two questions which, to save time, I will put to you
in categorical order. As a man of sense, it must at once
be apparent to you that you are guilty of a serious misdemeanor
in the eyes of the law for retaining a titled
and wealthy man without making a single effort to restore
him to his friends. To add to this, you have permitted
him to regain bodily health at the expense of his mind,
while proper medical treatment would doubtless have resulted
in sound reason also. To my thinking, this constitutes
in itself a most serious offense, as the natural conclusions
are that you have had but one end in view—extortion!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton flushed angrily and knitted his brows.</p>

<p>“Pray go on with your questions,” he said. “I am
prepared to answer.”</p>

<p>“Good,” the colonel replied. “Now, sir, when and
where did you first make the acquaintance of Sir Harold
Annesley?”</p>

<p>“Upon the very day that he disappeared. I am an
itinerant musician when money runs short, though this
has been my permanent home for fifteen years. I and my
daughter, by pure accident, turned into Annesley Park,
and, after hearing my child sing, Sir Harold was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
liberal with his money. By the same train that returned
to Tenterden, Sir Harold evidently intended to go to London,
but met with an accident, which will never be properly
explained except by himself, just outside the Tenterden
railway station. As is often the case, there was no
porter in attendance, for the train had to be stopped by
signal for me and Theresa—my daughter—to alight; and
it was not until the train had steamed away that I saw
the figure of a man lying at the mouth of the tunnel. I
went to his assistance, and, much against my will, was
forced to bring him here lest he should die.”</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Who was your confederate? You do not expect me
to believe that an aged man—a feeble man—could possibly
convey the insensible body of a big fellow like Sir
Harold Annesley for upward of a mile over an uneven
road!”</p>

<p>So saying, Greyson fixed upon Hamilton his keen eyes.</p>

<p>“I had no confederate, as you term it, unless you call
my Theresa a confederate,” the musician said. “In my
travels I take with me an harmonium, and that harmonium
is conveyed upon a flat carriage, which you may inspect
if you desire. Sir Harold’s inanimate form was
placed by myself and daughter upon that carriage and
brought here. As for my secrecy, I have my own private
reasons, with which my guest is fully acquainted.
Answering your complaint concerning proper medical
treatment, Sir Harold can satisfy you upon that point,
if he considers you worthy of implicit trust.”</p>

<p>The colonel bent one of his piercing glances upon Hamilton,
and held out his hand, saying:</p>

<p>“I believe you, sir. If I have been unreasonably suspicious,
forgive me. Now let me see the boy.”</p>

<p>“If you will step into my cottage, Colonel Greyson,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Hamilton said, courteously, “I will send Sir Harold to
you. He is somewhere in the garden, I have no doubt.”</p>

<p>The old soldier permitted himself to be conducted into
a little parlor fragrant with the incense of flowers.</p>

<p>“If you will wait here, colonel——”</p>

<p>“Certainly—certainly!” was the quick interruption.
“My nerves are simply quivering with the excitement of
expectancy.”</p>

<p>The musician withdrew, and when Sir Harold entered,
five minutes later, looking well and happy, the colonel
held out his hand, saying, tremulously, “Harold, my
boy, do you not know me?”</p>

<p>The young man took the proffered hand, but there
was a puzzled expression on his face.</p>

<p>“I have heard the name of Colonel Greyson very
often,” he said, “but I do not remember that we have
ever met before, sir.”</p>

<p>“My Heaven!” groaned the colonel, “this is terrible.
Why, my dear boy, who was it that got you out of your
scrapes at Cambridge? Who was it that undertook the
sole management of your business affairs while you went
trying to emulate Livingstone, Stanley and those fellows?”</p>

<p>Sir Harold laughed.</p>

<p>“You understand, colonel,” he said, “my friend, Mr.
Hamilton, who is in reality a clever surgeon, predicts
that I shall recover in time, and then we may be able to
enter into these matters with mutual interest. At present
they are of very little importance to me. Of course,
I have heard much that greatly concerns me, and I have
no desire to return to Annesley Park as an object of pity
and curiosity, if you will be so kind as to see that my
affairs do not get muddled. Perhaps I am asking too
much.”</p>

<p>“Asking too much?” the colonel interrupted, with tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
in his eyes. “I would lay down my life for you, Harold.
Now, tell me, do your thoughts ever return to Lady—to
Lady Elaine?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton has told me something of Lady Elaine,
but I really do not remember her, colonel. From what
I understand she must be a heartless beauty. I only wonder
that I was fool enough to succumb to her wiles.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to see her again?” Greyson asked.</p>

<p>“No—only perhaps out of idle curiosity,” was the indifferent
reply; “but there is one thing that I am anxious
about, Colonel Greyson. What do the newspapers say
about me—and about Lady Elaine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the usual twaddle. It is supposed that you went
away in a huff and are abroad again.”</p>

<p>“Capital!” laughed Sir Harold. “I could not bear to
be pitied as the brokenhearted lover, who, in addition,
had lost half his wits! I intend to remain here, colonel,
and rely upon you to keep my secret until I am again in
complete possession of my faculties. I can trust you—I
know that I can trust you, and let me confide to you something
concerning my host, who calls himself John Hamilton.”</p>

<p>He straightway repeated the old musician’s story, and
all became as clear as noonday to the brusque old soldier.</p>

<p>After conversing with Sir Harold for an hour the
colonel sought John Hamilton.</p>

<p>“I have to ask your pardon again,” he said. “Annesley
has told me sufficient to exculpate you completely. I
am almost ashamed of my unworthy suspicions, and I
am deeply sorry for you. Now, sir, I have not yet quite
resolved what is best to be done. Sir Harold does not
want to leave here until he is perfectly restored, and you,
as an eminent surgeon, may be able to give me some idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
of the extent of his malady. Can I introduce him to his
friends—to the world—in months, or years?”</p>

<p>“I have already carefully worked it out,” replied Hamilton,
readily, “and am of opinion that an operation is
necessary. There appears to be a clot of blood, or other
viscid matter, pressing upon some of the nerve-centers of
the brain. This matter may assimilate with the blood,
and it may remain where it is for many years unless removed
by a careful surgical operation.”</p>

<p>“Which you are willing to perform?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if it is Sir Harold’s wish.”</p>

<p>For a little while the colonel was thoughtful.</p>

<p>“We will not press the question yet,” he said, at last.
“I must discuss it with—er—other friends. He appears
to be very happy here, but his duties are elsewhere, and
he must be awakened to them. In a few days—a week
at most, Mr. Hamilton—I will come again, and I may
bring other friends with me. Good-day, and accept my
hearty thanks. I trust that our friendship, so awkwardly
begun, will be lifelong.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said John Hamilton, as he accompanied
him to the door.</p>

<p>At the end of one of the garden walks they saw Sir
Harold and Theresa stroll past, and the expression upon
the girl’s face was a revelation to Colonel Greyson.</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at Hamilton, remarking:</p>

<p>“I said that you should hear from me within a week.
Alter that to three days. Good-by, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good-day!” replied Hamilton; then he called angrily
to Theresa, and bade her attend to some household duties
while he lectured his guest.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold, it amounts to this: Until I hear from
your friends I will not give you permission to harbor the
slightest hope regarding my daughter. I even forbid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
you to speak to her except upon terms of the merest
civility. Her young life shall not be ruined!”</p>

<p>“I do not care one atom for the opinion of my friends,”
retorted Sir Harold. “Theresa is dearer to me than all
else in the world!”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait,” was the testy rejoinder. “You may
think differently in a few days’ time.”</p>

<p>“Never,” was the confident reply.</p>

<p>One—two—three days passed, and then a letter and
some newspapers came from Colonel Greyson.</p>

<p>This is the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Hamilton</span>—I do not think it necessary to subject
poor Annesley to a further operation. Let time work its
own cure. I left you full of hope, believing that he and Lady
Elaine Seabright had been the victims of a misunderstanding,
and with the confident intention of bringing them together again.
However, I was mistaken in my lady, and send to you papers
containing the news of her engagement to another man. This
may serve to dissipate any lingering doubts if Sir Harold should
recover sooner than we expect. You may use it how you please.
The affairs at Annesley Park are in the hands of competent
people, and I intend going to the Continent at once for the autumn
and winter. I will send you my address later. I strongly
counsel you to keep Sir Harold’s whereabouts a secret, or you
will be overrun with newspaper reporters, and the distressing
notoriety might retard his recovery. As I have practically assumed
control of Annesley’s affairs, I inclose you authority to
draw upon my bankers for any funds that may be required.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="salutation">Very faithfully yours,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Everard Greyson</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Hamilton turned to the newspapers and saw the items
to which the colonel referred, ejaculating:</p>

<p>“Thank God!”</p>

<p>He placed the letter and the papers in Sir Harold’s
hands, saying:</p>

<p>“I think that the bar is removed, and if you are sure
of your own heart, my darling child is yours. That she
loves you with the pure love of a romantic girl there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
no doubt, and with the passing years this will ripen into
the deep affection of a warm-hearted and noble woman.
I pray of the great Master of our lives that you may
never misunderstand my child, Sir Harold. She is giving
to you unreservedly every thought of her innocent
life, and to meet with coldness or indifference in return
would kill her as surely as a flower dies for lack of sunshine!
In some way I have all confidence in your chivalry
and devotion, and if there is any passing shade of
doubt it is when I think of the position that my child
must occupy as your wife. The world of fashion will
be so new and strange to her at first that you may suffer
some sense of disappointment if she prefers the quiet life
of home to the giddy whirl of society. But,” he added,
proudly, “I have no fear for the result. Theresa is a
lady by birth and instinct. In a few years she will fall
easily into the ways of fashion.”</p>

<p>A warm flush mantled the young man’s cheek and a
sparkle came into his eye.</p>

<p>“Theresa will be my fondest care,” he said. “I am
quite content with her as she is.”</p>

<p>He turned to the newspapers, and his lips curled with
scorn.</p>

<p>“The world makes light of the folly that is past.
Some day I may meet Lady Elaine Seabright again, and
if my contempt for her is as great as that which I feel for
myself it will be immeasurable.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A STRANGE WILL.</p>


<p>Miss Nugent was bitterly mortified by the action of
Colonel Greyson. He had promised to call upon her
mother, and instead had taken himself off, no one knew
whither, and with him the secret of Sir Harold’s movements.
He had not even troubled himself to write one
word of explanation.</p>

<p>She had waited for whole days in miserable expectation,
and then suddenly announced her determination of
calling upon the colonel.</p>

<p>“You will come with me, mamma, dear. I believe that
Colonel Greyson has news of Harold. He hinted as
much to me at Lady Gaynor’s ball, and I am so anxious.
It is not more than an hour’s drive to the colonel’s place.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nugent rarely attempted to combat the wishes
of her handsome daughter. She was one of those invalids
who find pleasure in nursing their own ailments,
and though it was a positive martyrdom to leave her
lounge for several hours, to be jolted over miles of
stony ground, she assented to the proposal with a long-drawn
sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>The carriage was ordered, and immediately after lunch
Mrs. Nugent and her daughter were driven to the colonel’s
cottage at Crayford.</p>

<p>To Margaret’s dismay there was an air of desertion
about the place, and she was informed by his house
keeper that her master was going abroad for the autumn
and winter.</p>

<p>“Then he has not yet gone?” asked Miss Nugent, with
a gasp of relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“No, ladies; but his man is upstairs packing, and he
knows more about it than I do.”</p>

<p>With a nod the woman ran into the house, and in a
few minutes the colonel’s military manservant appeared,
as straight and stiff as a ramrod.</p>

<p>“What is this I hear about the colonel, Simmons?”
asked Miss Nugent.</p>

<p>“My master is going away, madam,” replied Simmons,
saluting solemnly.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes! I have heard all about that. But where
is he now?”</p>

<p>Simmons looked surprised.</p>

<p>“In London by this time, Miss Nugent. He spent the
whole of yesterday at Annesley Park, and last evening
left for London, where I am to join him to-night.”</p>

<p>Miss Nugent bit her lips with vexation.</p>

<p>“It is extraordinary,” she said. “I really do not understand
Colonel Greyson, after his promise to me and
knowing how anxious I am concerning my luckless
cousin.”</p>

<p>The concluding part of her speech was uttered aside.</p>

<p>“My dear!” Mrs. Nugent mildly remonstrated, “I do
not see anything so extraordinary in it. You know what
the papers have said about Sir Harold, and it is quite
possible that the colonel intends joining him somewhere.
I am sure that I shall take a chill if we remain here
much longer.”</p>

<p>“You are sure that there is no message for us—for
me, Simmons?” continued Margaret.</p>

<p>“Quite sure, madam.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is possible that your master will write to me
from London, but I wish you to impress upon him some
sense of my great disappointment. He will understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
why, and I shall expect a lengthy letter of explanation
and particulars. You will not forget, Simmons?”</p>

<p>“No, madam.”</p>

<p>Simmons’ right hand flew up automatically in answer
to Miss Nugent’s farewell nod, and the carriage rolled
away.</p>

<p>“I cannot expect everything to fall into my lap,” she
thought, “and in one sense it is perhaps lucky that the
colonel has taken himself off, though his unlooked-for
movements have left me completely in the dark.”</p>

<p>As the carriage swept round a bend in the road, Annesley
Park was revealed with startling distinctness some
two miles distant. The towers and minarets stood
sharply against the purple sky, while a golden fire seemed
to flash from every window in the light of the sun.</p>

<p>“If we only had a fourth of Sir Harold’s money, how
happy we might be!” sighed Mrs. Nugent. “I really
think that he is most unkind in not giving the Park to us
while he is chasing wild beasts in Africa. I believe that
such an exhilarating prospect would almost give me
health again; or, at least, as much as I can ever expect to
enjoy.”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed musically.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” she said, “the Park may be our home yet!”</p>

<p>It was a prize worth scheming for, but, to do her justice,
Miss Nugent loved Sir Harold for himself alone.
How impatiently she awaited the letter-bag next morning,
only to be filled with a disappointment that almost
amounted to dismay. There was no letter from Colonel
Greyson, and she blamed herself for not insisting upon
his London address. Still, it was not too late to give up
hoping, and she denied herself several pleasures by remaining
at home throughout the day, so that she should
immediately receive any news that came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>In the evening a boy from the telegraph office delivered
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Margaret Nugent</span>—I have no good news for you, and
the less said the better. Time alone can straighten the tangle.
I leave London for Paris to-night. Kind regards.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Greyson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Margaret angrily tossed the telegram in the fire.</p>

<p>“A miserable evasion,” she muttered. “How much
does he suspect? I see through it all. He is taking
Harold abroad with him. If I only dared to follow them
and nurse my darling back to life! It may be months
or years, and with my lady out of the way my devotion
is sure to win in the end.”</p>

<p>That very night, at a late hour, some terrible news
reached the Nugents. The Earl of Seabright was dead,
killed while riding over his own estate. His horse had
stumbled over some hidden brambles, and my lord was
pitched headforemost to the earth. The land steward
was with him at the time, and the accident at first appeared
to be only a trivial one. The earl had struggled
up again, but only to sink back with a groan. The
shock had injured him internally, and he was carried to
his bedchamber a dying man.</p>

<p>“You have only an hour to live, my lord,” the hastily-summoned
doctor gravely told him. “If your affairs are
not in order there is no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>The earl listened incredulously at first.</p>

<p>“I suffer no pain,” he said. “Surely you are mistaken!
Am I to die because my horse stumbled—I, the maddest
rider in the county?”</p>

<p>“You are bleeding internally, my lord. No human
power can save you,” was the decided reply.</p>

<p>Then the earl had wept childishly for a little while,
and sent hastily for the nearest lawyer. He wished to
make a new will—to appoint fresh executors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>The lawyer came and was closeted with the dying earl
for half-an-hour.</p>

<p>“Now read it over carefully,” the earl said, and the
lawyer obeyed him.</p>

<p>The will was short and concise. My lord left the
whole of his personality to his only child, the Lady Elaine,
upon the condition that she became the wife of Viscount
Henry Rivington within six months of the date of the
will. If she refused to obey this last wish of the earl his
fortune would pass away to various charitable institutions,
which were carefully named. In addition, the viscount
was made joint-executor with Lady Gaynor. As
the title and estate of Seabright Hall reverted to the next
male heir in succession the earl’s daughter would be under
the immediate control of the executors. There was a
clause to the effect that if the marriage was not consummated,
through the refusal or inability of the viscount to
ratify the contract, the whole of the earl’s fortune would
be devoted to the exclusive enjoyment of his daughter,
the Lady Elaine Seabright.</p>

<p>In the presence of many witnesses the will was signed,
and twenty minutes later my lord breathed his last.</p>

<p>It was an impressive scene. The awful suddenness
seemed to have bewildered everybody, and Lady Elaine
hardly realized that her father was, indeed, no more until
she was gently led from the death-chamber by Lady Gaynor
and the doctor.</p>

<p>The earl had ever been a selfish man, but, notwithstanding
her loveless life, the full force of her loss seemed
to numb every sense for a time.</p>

<p>At last she burst into a passion of tears. How well
she understood his last words to her, and how her soul
revolted from the wishes they expressed.</p>

<p>“We quarreled this morning, Elaine. Do not let a last
disobedience haunt you through life. I mean all for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
best, child. Annesley has left you to humiliation and
scorn. Obey my last wishes, and some day you will
understand that I have acted harshly to be kind.”</p>

<p>Her reply had been a sob, and a few moments later a
quick, fluttering sigh told that all was over.</p>

<p>He was gone—first her lover, and then her father; and,
locked in her own apartments, she gave way to her grief
in sobs and tears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">AN EVIL GENIUS.</p>


<p>It was not until the funeral was over and my lord’s
last will and testament had been read that Lady Elaine
Seabright was brought to a knowledge of her true position.</p>

<p>She had many sympathizing friends, and the new earl
and lord of the domain kindly offered to leave the house
and effects at her disposal for any reasonable length of
time.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” he added, magnanimously, “with the consent
of my wife and daughters, I may offer you a home here
until the viscount claims you. The late earl and I were
not good friends simply because he had no son and I was
his natural heir.”</p>

<p>Elaine thanked her cousin, but told him that what he
had proposed was impossible.</p>

<p>The old family lawyer was thoroughly indignant, and
muttered threats about contesting the last will; but what
could he do in face of a dozen witnesses, who were all
convinced that the earl’s mind had been clear to the last?
Besides, Lady Elaine would never have consented to such
a course of action.</p>

<p>“Even if you cared for this man—this Viscount Rivington—the
will places you in a most humiliating position,
my lady,” he told her, indignantly. “By what I
gather, it was made really in the heat of anger, notwithstanding
the fact that the earl was dying. You had
resolutely declined to encourage the advances of Rivington
that very morning and my lord was determined that
he should be your husband. In an apparently easy-going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
way your father was a perfect martinet. He generally
had his own way, even if he waited long years for the
opportunity. And then why should the original executors
be struck out—myself and Colonel Greyson?”</p>

<p>Mr. Worboys snorted angrily, and stamped to and fro
across the floor of the library, where he had come at
Lady Elaine’s bidding, so that she might learn her true
position.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt at all that you have been treated
badly by Sir Harold Annesley,” he went on, but Lady
Elaine interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Please do not speak of Sir Harold,” she said. “My
heart tells me that he will come back to me some day.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lady,” proceeded Mr. Worboys, “it amounts
to this: If you refuse to wed Viscount Rivington you
will lose a fortune of nearly half-a-million sterling and an
income of ten or twelve thousand a year.”</p>

<p>“I have my private fortune,” she reminded him.</p>

<p>“A paltry five hundred a year,” he told her, “and even
that is under the control of your guardians until you are
of age.”</p>

<p>“It appears that I am practically bound hand and foot,”
she said, bitterly. “Must I submit to these people?”</p>

<p>She stood erect, with flashing eyes, and deathly-white
face—a pathetic figure in her loneliness.</p>

<p>“Cannot you help me, Mr. Worboys?”</p>

<p>“The law will not permit of my interference, my lady.
Now, look at matters on their brightest side. Within one
year you will be of age and your own mistress. You are
determined to lose your fortune rather than marry Viscount
Rivington. No one can legally force you into this
marriage, and if undue pressure is brought to bear upon
you, then I may be able to step in to your assistance.
What manner of woman is this Lady Gaynor?”</p>

<p>“I do not like her,” Elaine replied. “I do not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
why, but we were never upon friendly terms. Had my
father lived I believe that he would have made Lady
Gaynor the Countess of Seabright.”</p>

<p>The old lawyer was silent for a little while, then he
glanced at the girl pityingly and said:</p>

<p>“I do not think that we can improve matters by remaining
here longer, Lady Elaine. Above all, we must avoid
arousing suspicion. Note carefully the manner in which
Lady Gaynor approaches you, and always rely upon my
active friendship whenever such is possible.”</p>

<p>Mr. Worboys went back to London, and for three or
four days Lady Elaine was practically left to her own
devices, while her maid was busy packing up.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, however, there was a letter from Lady
Gaynor, which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady Elaine</span>—I sincerely trust that the first edge of
your grief is dulled by this time, and that you have made preparations
for leaving the old home. The new earl has been extremely
kind and considerate toward you. According to the
provisions of your father’s will, I and Viscount Rivington are in
a measure responsible for you, and as you are practically without
a fortune, your future home must be the best I can afford.
The Lodge will doubtless appear a very insignificant place after
the splendid surroundings of Seabright Hall. Still, none of us
can choose our own lot in life, and the dear viscount has
acquiesced to all my proposals. I have written to your cousin,
the new earl, informing him that it is my intention to relieve
him of further responsibility, so far as you are concerned, to-morrow
morning. Your very dear friend, Miss Nugent, will
accompany me.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="salutation">Sincerely yours,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Eleanor Gaynor</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Elaine shivered when she read the letter. There
was something ominous in its softly-turned sentences.</p>

<p>At dinner the earl broached the subject.</p>

<p>“If you are not quite ready to leave, Lady Elaine,” he
said, “I shall be glad to have you here as long as it suits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
your own convenience. The countess and the girls will
be here next week.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Elaine replied, listlessly. “There is no
reason that I should delay the inevitable. I will leave
Seabright Hall to-morrow morning with Lady Gaynor.”</p>

<p>“A strange choice of the late earl’s,” he mused. “Lady
Gaynor is notorious in certain circles. She is miserably
poor, and makes an income by coaching the daughters of
rich Americans and successful tradesmen generally.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine did not reply, but again that icy shudder
passed through her, leaving her as cold as death. Her
great sorrow had left her numb and spiritless.</p>

<p>Lady Gaynor came next morning; she was a large,
handsome woman of fifty or thereabouts—a woman with
determination marked in every line of her smiling face.
For ten years she had succeeded in maintaining a small
estate known as “The Lodge” upon absolutely no assured
income at all. The house and lands were incumbered, but
Lady Gaynor had managed, so far, to keep off the marauding
hands of the money-lenders. But of late her
practices had obtained the severe notice of people who
moved in the charmed circle of the court, and Lady Gaynor
knew that she must employ sharp wits in other directions,
or fall a prey to the harpies which, like the vampire,
feed upon the blood of human hearts. Then the Earl of
Seabright in some way became entangled in her toils, and
many rumors were rife when he died. This was a serious
blow to Lady Gaynor, but there was one hope still
left. Upon his marriage with Lady Elaine, Viscount
Rivington had promised her a handsome check—a check
that would free her of the Jews, and still leave a respectable
sum with which to make fresh ventures. It was really
a matter of life and death to Lady Gaynor.</p>

<p>“My dear girl!” she said, effusively kissing one of Lady
Elaine’s pale cheeks, “how sweet of you to be so considerate!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Here you are quite ready, and we shall be back
at the Lodge in time for lunch.”</p>

<p>Then Margaret Nugent came forward and greeted
Elaine with a great show of affection. She could afford
now to be affectionate in reality, for she no longer regarded
Lady Elaine as a rival.</p>

<p>The drive to the Lodge was without incident, and Lady
Gaynor showed the girl to a suite of shabbily-furnished
rooms. The curtains were dingy, the carpets threadbare,
and there was an air of mustiness everywhere that was
stifling.</p>

<p>“Ah! I can see disappointment in your face,” her ladyship
said, with well-assumed regret, “but this is the best
that I can offer. Let us hope that you will soon reign
as mistress of a home equal to the one you have left.
I shall then expect you to requite the kindness I am endeavoring
to extend to you now. Ah! how selfish poverty
makes us all, Lady Elaine. You do not care to
come down for lunch? Well, you shall have a cup of tea
up here and spend the rest of the day as you please, assisting
your maid to unpack.”</p>

<p>Lady Gaynor went away, and a little later Margaret
Nugent came to say good-by.</p>

<p>“I am going home,” she said, “because mamma has a
fresh attack of fancied woes. Shall I bring the pony-carriage
to-morrow, and we will have a long drive?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Margaret,” said Lady Elaine, “I think
that I hate the old, familiar scenes. My great trouble has
fallen on me with the weight of an avalanche. I do not
seem able to realize it yet. My lover—my father—all—at
one blow. My energy—my spirit is killed within
me!”</p>

<p>“Time will soften your grief, Elaine,” said Margaret,
gently. “There is a great future before you—a future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
bright with triumph and splendor, if you only grasp it
aright.”</p>

<p>There seemed to be a hidden meaning in Margaret’s
words.</p>

<p>“I believe that I understand you, Miss Nugent,” Elaine
said, coldly; “but I fail to appreciate your counsels. In
some way my troubles began when I was weak enough to
listen to your advice. I accepted it against my better
judgment, and I beg of you not to refer to matters which
particularly concern myself again. In my present loneliness
I need friends badly enough, Heaven knows, but
I can never associate you with anything but unpleasantness
and misery. I feel that you are my enemy, and am
only sorry that I did not make the discovery sooner. The
very fact that you are a close associate of my oppressors
precludes the possibility of any sympathy between us, and
I shall consider it a favor if you will cease making any
pretenses of affection for me in the future. I must now
know upon whom I can depend, Miss Nugent, and I can
neither accept you as a confidante nor an adviser. I am
not superstitious, but there is a fatality about some people
which it is impossible to withstand, and everything in
connection with yourself has resulted in evil for me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” Miss Nugent said, and her face was
pale. “Can it be possible, Lady Elaine, that you regard
me as a sort of evil genius?”</p>

<p>“That is just it. In some way I feel that you are my
evil genius!” Elaine replied.</p>

<p>Without a word, Margaret Nugent turned away, and
the two girls did not meet again for many months.</p>

<p class="center">LADY GAYNOR SHOWS HER HAND.</p>


<p>A week passed, and Lady Elaine had been permitted to
indulge in almost perfect seclusion, but at length a message
was sent to her announcing that Lady Gaynor wished
to see her in her <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>The servant who delivered it glanced pityingly at the
black-robed figure, and told the shabbily-dressed butler a
little later that the atmosphere would soon be sultry.</p>

<p>The butler smiled, as only an upper servant can smile,
and remarked:</p>

<p>“We are hall hinterested in this last spec., John. Three
years’ money owin’ to me, an’ not a stitch to my back,
hardly. If her ladyship hadn’t hev explained, it meant
a county court case for her.”</p>

<p>John smirked.</p>

<p>“It’s hin the <i>boudoir</i>, eh?” continued the butler.
“Then that’s hominous.”</p>

<p>“How blood do tell,” said the footman. “I was hordered
to deliver the message peremptory like, and you
should hev seen the beautiful young lady’s eyes flash!”</p>

<p>“Look ’ere, don’t you take sides with her, John, because
my back pay depends hon the winnin’ side being
Lady Gaynor.”</p>

<p>The footman’s manner had seemed extremely rude to
Lady Elaine, and Nina had strongly resented it by closing
the door in his face.</p>

<p>It is true that Elaine had met one or two kindly inquiries
with an exasperating indifference, and Lady Gaynor
decided that it was time to show her authority.</p>

<p>Fully understanding that the servant’s manner was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
but a reflection of that of his mistress, Lady Elaine
promptly attended the summons, her blood raised to a
white heat of indignation.</p>

<p>She paused momentarily at the half-open door of her
ladyship’s <i>boudoir</i>, and immediately heard the soft, cooing
tones of the woman she hated and distrusted.</p>

<p>“Is that you, child? Come in, and close the door after
you. I am far from feeling well this morning, and the
tiresome viscount has written to say that he is coming
to dinner to-day. Will you sit down, please, Lady
Elaine? Nothing makes me so uncomfortable as to see
my friends standing about the rooms when I wish to
talk to them.”</p>

<p>She sighed, and arranged the folds of her dirty dressing-gown,
watching the girl at the same time from the
corners of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Lady Gaynor,” Elaine said, haughtily, “I am here to
learn what it is you wish to communicate to me. Mind
you, I am not to be deceived by this outward complaisance
after your bold attempt to humiliate me in the eyes
of your servants!”</p>

<p>For a few moments the cool woman of the world was
taken completely off her guard.</p>

<p>“My dear Elaine,” she said, aghast, “whatever are you
driving at?”</p>

<p>Inwardly she reflected: “I have heard that she has a
temper of her own, but it must be crushed! Backed by
strong friends and perfect independence, the task might
be a difficult one, but now—faugh!”</p>

<p>She eyed the angry girl with a glance that gradually
deepened into a smile of bitterest contempt.</p>

<p>“Is it to be open warfare between us, Lady Elaine?” she
asked, sneeringly, a baleful light in her deep-set eyes.
“As you appear to have taken the initiative, I must accept
the impudent challenge!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“It is as well that we should at once understand each
other,” the earl’s daughter replied, icily.</p>

<p>“I agree with you there perfectly, my lady, and for
that very reason I sent for you here. My frankness may
appear almost brutal, but you yourself have forced me
to cease from paltering with words. My lady of Seabright,
you must forget that you are the daughter of an
earl, and remember that you are practically little better
than a pauper upon my bounty.”</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>Elaine advanced one step, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Who dares to beard me on my own ground!”
screamed Lady Gaynor, losing all control of herself.
“Girl, I am your legal guardian, and will force you into
obedience! Do you think that I will permit my guests
to be insulted as you insulted Miss Nugent? Do you
think that I will endure your moping away in silence,
with a maid dancing attendance upon you at my expense?
What is your paltry five hundred a year? It will not
keep personal attendants and buy you handsome clothes.
I say that your maid shall be dismissed this very day;
I insist that you appear downstairs at my request, and
amuse my guests. I am determined to exercise my full
authority, and since you have treated the viscount so
shamefully I am sure that he will exact a similar obedience.”</p>

<p>At the end of her tirade she rose to her feet, her face
purple with unbridled rage, and shook both her tightly-clinched
hands at the astonished girl.</p>

<p>“Have you finished?” Lady Elaine asked, calmly. “I
do not forget that the blood of a hundred earls flows in
my veins! I am not to be frightened by a creature like
you. Your melodramatic ravings are more amusing than
otherwise. I need say little more. I ignore your commands
and wishes alike, because I despise you for an unprincipled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
adventuress. You must not imagine that I
am wholly without friends, and I give you warning that
I shall quit the Lodge to-day!”</p>

<p>With a glance of withering contempt, Lady Elaine
swept from the room. She hurried to her own apartments,
and commanded Nina to begin packing at once.</p>

<p>“I have quarreled with Lady Gaynor,” she said, “and
we cannot remain here another hour. Oh, Nina, I am
in great trouble, and now I want your help and sympathy.
The mistress of this place has insulted me cruelly, and I
must seek the advice of Mr. Worboys, our old family
lawyer, at the earliest possible moment.”</p>

<p>“And where shall we go to, my lady?” ventured Nina.</p>

<p>“To London—to a hotel. I have five hundred pounds
a year, surely they cannot deprive me of that! Then we
will find a comfortable little home somewhere, Nina, and
you shall stay with me as long as you like—not as a mere
servant—but as a friend, the most faithful friend I have
ever had.”</p>

<p>Nina’s face flushed with pleasure, and she clapped her
hands together joyously.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lady, won’t that be nice! But what a shame
for all your fortune to go because of that wretched will.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Nina; I never wish to think of it again. Never
before was a poor mortal so afflicted as I, but beyond the
black clouds of the present I have faith that there is a
golden promise that will blossom into glorious fruition.
I know that my lover will come back to me some day—and
I shall wait—even if it is until I am old and gray.
Bitter as my sorrows have been, the most dreadful blow
has not fallen. There is no proof that Sir Harold has
been false to me. If this were so, then I should be
stricken with death, indeed!”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine shed a few tears, then, with rapid and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
decisive movements, assisted her maid to turn out the
contents of drawers and wardrobes, and pack them into
her traveling trunks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Lady Gaynor had sent an urgent telegram
to the viscount, who was dutifully visiting his octogenarian
uncle, the Duke of Rothwell. The duke’s country
seat was within twenty miles of Ashbourne, and the
viscount had many reasons for trying to conciliate the
old gentleman. In the first place, his grace had complete
control of every acre of his possessions. There was not
a square yard of entail, and the viscount had never been a
favorite with his uncle.</p>

<p>When the telegram arrived, Rivington was reading
that morning’s <i>Times</i> to the Duke of Rothwell. The
day was bright and warm, and they were sunning themselves
on one of the terraces that overlooked miles of
undulating woodland.</p>

<p>“What is that, Henry?” asked his grace, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Lady Gaynor desires my immediate presence at the
Lodge,” replied Rivington, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>“Lady Gaynor!” echoed the duke, contemptuously.
“You must break with that woman, Henry. Let me see
the telegram.”</p>

<p>Rivington reluctantly handed the slip of pink paper
to his uncle, who slowly read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You must come at once. Trouble with the girl.—<span class="smcap">Gaynor.</span></p>
</div>

<p>“Trouble with the girl,” repeated the duke, suspiciously.
“What does that mean? No deception, please. I endured
quite enough of that in your young days, when
you used money that did not belong to you. Sometimes
I think that I have been a fool to take you back again and
make you a handsome allowance. It is hard to believe
in the reformation of a blackleg and a gambler. But
my will is not yet made in your favor, and all depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
upon your marriage with Lady Elaine Seabright. After
that there is some hope for you!”</p>

<p>“Uncle!” pleaded Rivington. “How unkind you are!”</p>

<p>“The telegram, the telegram!” was the interruption.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is nothing. The facts are simple. Of
course, everybody is aware of Lady Gaynor’s crippled
condition so far as finances go, and I recently recommended
to her care the—er—sister of a fellow I know,
who suffers with periodical attacks of mild insanity—the
result of a carriage accident. Her brother was willing
to pay a decent sum to any one who would take particular
care of the girl until she was quite recovered, and I recommended
Lady Gaynor. That is all there is in it. It
is a great nuisance at all events, just now.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Is that the truth?” the duke grunted.</p>

<p>“My dear uncle,” exclaimed Rivington, distressfully,
“it pains me beyond measure that you should continue to
doubt me.”</p>

<p>“Can you wonder at it? Well, I suppose that you must
leave me. If it was anywhere but Lady Gaynor’s place I
would go with you. I can’t think what possessed the Earl
of Seabright when he mixed that woman up with his
affairs. I must see Lady Elaine as soon as she has got
over her spell of grief. I must hear from her own lips
that she intends to marry you, and then you may depend
upon getting something from me besides the title. I
won’t believe one word of the story until her ladyship
confirms it. It will ever be a mystery to me how you
managed to ingratiate yourself in the Earl of Seabright’s
good graces. He was no fool, and must have known
what a worthless scoundrel you were in your younger
days. I would see you hanged before you should marry a
daughter of mine, no matter how much you promised to
reform. I have no belief in reformed rakes. Confound
it, I am almost disposed to put a stop to this abominable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
marriage, but I suppose that Lady Elaine knows her own
business best. There never is any accounting for taste—particularly
a woman’s! Not only are you deficient in
what I consider the ordinary attributes of manhood, but
you are small and insignificant. You will be the most
undignified Duke of Rothwell that has ever borne the
title. Why the deuce didn’t I marry myself, I wonder!”</p>

<p>Inwardly the viscount was fuming. He hated his
uncle, and cursed Lady Gaynor for a fool. Why had she
sent the insane telegram? What had she done to Lady
Elaine?</p>

<p>When once beyond the notice of the old duke, his haste
became almost frantic. He helped the groom to saddle a
horse, and then galloped away as though upon an errand
of life and death.</p>

<p>In less than two hours he was pacing Lady Gaynor’s
drawing-room, hot, dust-stained and angry; and when her
ladyship appeared his irritability burst out.</p>

<p>“Well! Until now I have looked upon you as a woman
of sense. That telegram nearly exploded the whole business
to the duke!”</p>

<p>“Why should the duke see it?”</p>

<p>“See it he did. Now for the trouble. What is the
matter?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“My lady is packing up. She refuses to remain here
longer, and, of course, we must use our authority.”</p>

<p>“Use our authority,” he sneered. “I suppose you have
been using your infernal temper, woman-like! Where
is your tact? A girl of Lady Elaine’s spirit would submit
to no living woman—not even you. It appears that I
have been depending upon a broken reed!”</p>

<p>“What was I to do? I have tried kindness in vain, and
I consider that——”</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t employ your extraordinary considering
powers again,” Rivington interrupted savagely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
“My very life depends upon my marriage with Lady
Elaine. If the duke discovers that he has been deceived
I shall be a titled pauper. I lose both fortunes—while
you will find a resting place from your labors in one of
her majesty’s prisons. It is a serious offense to purchase
thousands of pounds’ worth of jewelry on credit and to
pawn it the same day.”</p>

<p>Lady Gaynor was deathly pale.</p>

<p>“Now,” he continued, a little more calmly, “tell me
exactly what has taken place.”</p>

<p>“If you persist in your taunts,” she told him, “I may
have something to say. As for this girl, I tell you that it
is impossible to manage her, and the marriage will have
to be forced. Money will do anything. I repeat that I
have tried kindness in vain, and because I remonstrated
with her this morning she flew into a temper, and declared
her intention of quitting the Lodge at once. As
her legal guardians we must exercise our authority.”</p>

<p>He did not reply immediately, but continued to pace the
floor. At last he came to a standstill, and said:</p>

<p>“Lady Elaine will not be coerced into anything, and it
was a mistake to bring her here at all. Your suggestion
of compelling her to suitably respond to the marriage lines
must only be adopted as a last desperate resort. I do not
even wish to hear you hint at the means to be employed at
present, because, independently of what the marriage
means to me, I honestly love the earl’s daughter.”</p>

<p>Lady Gaynor laughed doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Rivington, without deigning to notice
the interruption, “for the present I shall assume
active control of affairs, and Lady Elaine will be permitted
to follow her own devices. I shall even advise her
to hasten her departure, and constitute myself her guide
and protector. Apparently you and I will be upon very
bad terms. In this way I shall enlist her confidence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
also keep her in sight. If my plan fails, well, then we
must have recourse to something which requires the nerve
of a bad woman to formulate and successfully accomplish.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” said Lady Gaynor.</p>

<p class="center">THE VISCOUNT’S SCHEME.</p>


<p>Rivington scribbled the following in his notebook, and
for a minute reflected intently:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Lady Elaine</span>—I have just reached here to learn that
there has been some unpleasantness between you and Lady Gaynor.
She evidently imagined that I should sanction any course
she was pleased to take, but has been woefully disappointed. I
quite agree with you that the Lodge cannot longer be your home,
and my active advice, if required, is at your service. If you will
see me for a few minutes I shall be happy to assist you to the
utmost of my limited powers, without in the last interfering with
your freedom of thought and action.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="salutation">Very sincerely yours,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Henry Rivington</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>He tore the leaf containing the message out of his
notebook, and handed it to Lady Gaynor to read, remarking:</p>

<p>“This merely foreshadows my plan of campaign. In
any event, I am determined to make Lady Elaine the
future Duchess of Rothwell, and the sooner the ceremony
takes place the better for me and for you. My uncle refuses
to make a new will until Lady Elaine is either my
wife or he is convinced that nothing less than a miracle
can prevent her being so. He is not content with my
mere word or printed notices in the newspapers. He
wishes confirmation from my lady’s own lips. So far,
luck has ever been attendent upon me. I shall now pose
in the character of the chivalrous but unhappy lover. A
week or two will decide me upon its ultimate success. If
the plan does not work, I shall require your services again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Lady Gaynor, and the business will have to be put in hand
with expedition. I care not what means are employed.”</p>

<p>“I will be in readiness, viscount,” her ladyship replied,
with an evil smile. “Lady Elaine has made an enemy of
me, and to punish her I am resolved that she shall be
your wife.”</p>

<p>She laughed maliciously.</p>

<p>“After that she will always be in my power, more or
less.”</p>

<p>He pretended not to notice this ambiguous speech, but
said:</p>

<p>“I shall deliver my written message in person. It is
impossible that I may not have an opportunity of speaking
to you again to-day, but I will keep you alive regarding
my movements.”</p>

<p>“<i>Au revoir!</i> my dear boy. I think that there is nothing
more to say. You will make me out a monster of
iniquity to her ladyship, and your own virtues will shine
with luminous brightness against my dark background.
You have a subtle brain, and the scheme would work admirably
with any ordinary girl, but Lady Elaine Seabright
is not an ordinary girl. Unfortunately, viscount, you are
not an Apollo, like the recreant Sir Harold, for instance,
and I am afraid that the part you have chosen does not
suit you. The stage villain is more in your line!”</p>

<p>The viscount did not relish her raillery, but with a bow
and a muttered good-morning he left the room in quest of
Lady Elaine, conscious that the butler was ever on the
alert.</p>

<p>In answer to his gentle knock the door was opened by
Nina, and the viscount’s quick eyes saw that the girl was
flushed and trembling with excitement. The floor was
littered with hastily-packed boxes.</p>

<p>“Can I see your mistress, Nina?” he asked, softly and
kindly. “Nay, I have no wish to intrude, and will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
here again in ten minutes’ time. Meanwhile, give Lady
Elaine this note from me.”</p>

<p>The maid took the scrap of paper from him, and when
he returned in the time he had named he was immediately
admitted by Nina.</p>

<p>Lady Elaine was standing in the middle of the shabby
little sitting-room, his note between her fingers, and at
sight of her graceful, haughty figure and beautiful face,
the viscount’s heart throbbed with its old passion.</p>

<p>He stepped forward with what appeared to be warm
impulsiveness, and gently took one of her hands between
his.</p>

<p>“I have heard something of the annoyance to which you
have been subjected by that vulgar woman downstairs.
Indeed, she telegraphed to me,” he added, with an air of
candor, “and the result has not been pleasant to her. I
believe that we have good and sufficient grounds to cause
her co-guardianship to be rescinded. I applaud your determination
to leave this wretched house, and only hope
that I may be permitted to help you in some way.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, viscount,” Lady Elaine said, gratefully.
“I scarcely knew how you would view my conduct.”</p>

<p>“You could not believe that I would oppose you, Lady
Elaine?” he said, softly. “I had no hand in bringing you
here. I had no knowledge even of the late earl’s choice of
executors until it was too late to offer a protest upon my
own behalf at least. The position naturally prejudices
me in your eyes.”</p>

<p>“No! No!” the girl interjected.</p>

<p>“As for Lady Gaynor, she merits nothing but my contempt.
She is a violent and dangerous woman. This
house is nightly the resort of gamblers, and it is wonderful
the influence that she obtained over the late earl. I
have myself lost fabulous sums of money among the card-sharpers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
who frequent the place. I make this confession
with shame, but Lady Gaynor and I are open foes at
last!”</p>

<p>“I believe that I have misjudged you, and I am sorry,
viscount,” said Elaine, a little penitently.</p>

<p>It was so sweet to have a friend at this unlooked-for
moment—a friend in one whom she had feared would be
an enemy!</p>

<p>“You are nearly ready to leave!” he observed, glancing
around.</p>

<p>“I shall be quite ready in an hour.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask whither? I would like to take you to
my uncle’s place—Rothwell Abbey—but I do not wish
it to appear that I have any hand in shaping your course.
At the same time I should like to help you.”</p>

<p>“I intended going direct to a London hotel—I and my
maid,” Elaine said, “and then seeking for a pretty home
somewhere in the country. I have a few hundred pounds
in money, and there is my private fortune. Now that I
have your friendship, viscount, I know that no bar will
be put against my deriving full benefit from that. You
see my plans are very simple,” she added, pathetically; “I
have no desire to meet those friends who have nothing but
pity for me, and my soul sickens at the thought of
gayety.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with all you say; indeed, nothing could
be better under existing circumstances,” the viscount said.
“I will order the carriage to be ready in an hour. The
luggage had better precede us to the railway station, if it
is ready. Allow me to tighten the straps.”</p>

<p>He busied himself for some minutes, then asked if
lunch should be sent upstairs.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” Lady Elaine said. “I shall not
breathe freely until I am out of this house forever. I
shall never forget your kindness, viscount.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes and in her voice, and Rivington
felt that his cause was half won.</p>

<p>“I will accompany you to London,” he said. “A man
is useful in looking after things, and I may be able to
assist you in the choice of a house. I know every inch of
the suburbs. I would suggest a pretty villa in the vicinity
of Hyde Park—a sort of combination of country and
town, where people mind their own business. The ordinary
country village is a perfect hotbed of malicious gossip.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that I shall be content to leave the selection
in your hands,” Lady Elaine replied, thoughtfully. “And
it will, perhaps, be wise to be within easy reach of Mr.
Worboys.”</p>

<p>“The late family lawyer!” the viscount exclaimed, incautiously,
but added quickly, “yes, and you may have
need of his services soon. Lady Elaine, at present I
stand between you and a vast fortune. You know what
my hopes have been and ever will be, but I want you to
acquit me of having any hand in that infamous will! It
is impossible to alter it, but I am not so mean a cur that
I will permit you to lose one shilling because I suffer the
keenest disappointment that it is possible for man to endure
and live!”</p>

<p>She looked at him gratefully, and he pressed her hand
in silence.</p>

<p>“There,” he concluded, “I will send the cart to the door
for your luggage, and find that prying footman something
to do. You have selected your train, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Two-thirty from Ashbourne,” Elaine said.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he went on, consulting his watch, “the
carriage shall be waiting at two.”</p>

<p>He bowed gracefully, and left the room with the feelings
of a victor.</p>

<p>“I shall win her,” he thought. “Aye, in a canter, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
verily believe. Sympathy and kindness appeal to her
haughty soul.”</p>

<p>At two o’clock Lady Elaine, Viscount Rivington and
Nina, the maid, left the Lodge in Lady Gaynor’s rickety
brougham, and were driven to Ashbourne station.</p>

<p>“It happears to me,” remarked the butler to the footman,
“that there’s a good chance of our getting the back
wages, but hang me if I can see the drift of the little
game.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THERESA’S LOVE.</p>


<p>Never until Sir Harold Annesley came into her life
had Theresa Hamilton understood the ecstatic joy of living.
The songs of the birds were tuned afresh, the
flowers took on a newer bloom, and the bees that buzzed
in the blossoming garden told but one story, and its name
was Love—beautiful Love!</p>

<p>In a few short weeks she had changed from a girl into
a woman, and the soft, happy light that shone in her glorious,
Southern eyes told its own story.</p>

<p>And now that Mr. Hamilton had given his consent to
Sir Harold’s wooing, he became aware that Theresa
wanted new frocks, and things of which most girls are
proud.</p>

<p>One day he called her to him.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he said, kissing her tenderly, “in one
way I have been very unkind to you, and you have never
once complained.”</p>

<p>She looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“You do not understand me, Theresa?”</p>

<p>“No, father; because I do not know the meaning of
unkindness. You have ever striven hard to teach me
all those accomplishments that are so essential to women
of refinement. I never knew their value until——”</p>

<p>She hesitated, and he asked:</p>

<p>“Until when, Theresa?”</p>

<p>“Until Sir Harold expressed his pleasure and surprise,”
she replied, blushing vividly and burying her face on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Theresa,” her father went on, “I will tell you how I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
have been unkind, though my motives in all things concerning
you have been actuated by my keen desire to leave
you in some way provided for. Have you ever wanted
nicer frocks and boots, and all those little fineries that
add a charm to woman’s dress?”</p>

<p>“No, but I should like them now,” she replied, naïvely,
“only that I know we are poor.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall have them,” he promised her, with a
sparkle of triumph in his eyes. “I have a little money
put away, Theresa—a little hoard of gold which I have
saved for you. What do you say to going with me to
one of the big towns and choosing all that you require?”</p>

<p>She clapped her hands gleefully. “I wonder what Sir
Harold will think of me then,” she laughed.</p>

<p>It was always Sir Harold first with her now, and her
father smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>“Well, Theresa, is it settled? I am feeling better to-day
than I have for years. A burden seems to have been
lifted from about me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, I am so happy! Is it much money that
you have saved—very much?”</p>

<p>“Enough for present needs, Theresa, and I have
dreamed of buying this little house in which to spend
the evening of my life, but it may not be needed now.”</p>

<p>He looked wistfully from the window, adding: “How
strange are Thy ways, O Providence! * * * Well,
Theresa, we must start early, and for a few hours leave
Sir Harold to his flowers and books.”</p>

<p>The girl ran about the house like a happy child. A
new world was opening to her, filled with unexpected
treasures, as beautiful even as the stories of fairydom.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton took his daughter to a town called Farnwell,
and left her in the hands of a firm of <i>costumiers</i>,
while he made other purchases. He spent his money
freely, and it seemed to afford him infinite satisfaction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
A further visit to Farnwell was made a few days later,
followed by several large parcels which were delivered by
the local carrier.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and, after the midday meal,
Sir Harold was startled by a vision of beauty that suddenly
appeared before him. It was Theresa in one of
her new frocks—a perfect-fitting dress of creamy, shimmering
stuff, a coral necklet round her ivory throat, and
a bunch of scarlet poppies in her hair.</p>

<p>“Theresa!” gasped Sir Harold. “Surely not. Oh,
how lovely you are, little one!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I am so glad if you are pleased!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was looking on, and a deep sigh escaped
him.</p>

<p>“It is her mother over again,” he said, in a half-whisper.
“I never noticed it before. The likeness is
almost fatal. They would know her anywhere!”</p>

<p>He shuddered, and his face blanched. But with Sir
Harold his darling would be safe!</p>

<p>He watched them into the garden, Theresa looking
trustfully up at the man she loved, and her happy laughter
ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>“I never knew the meaning of real happiness until
now,” she was saying to the young baronet; “my father
has always told me that it was illusive, and the mere imaginings
of the poets and romancists.”</p>

<p>“But it is real, Theresa, is it not? We have proved
it to be so,” replied the baronet.</p>

<p>“How could it be otherwise when we love so well?”
she whispered.</p>

<p>He did not reply; he was thinking what a pleasant duty
it was to take care of this lovely child, who lived wholly
and solely for him.</p>

<p>“As my wife, Theresa, you will some day be one of
the highest ladies in the land,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be one of the proudest and happiest, Harold.
I covet no greater honor than to be by your side in a cottage
or a palace.”</p>

<p>“We will live abroad for a few years,” he went on,
“until my memory is fully restored. Then I can return
to the home of my ancestors without fear.”</p>

<p>“And if you should ever meet and recognize the Lady
Elaine?” she asked him, her face paling at the thought.</p>

<p>“It is hardly likely,” he laughed. “I must have hated
her when I went away—hated myself for my folly. She
will never cross my path again.”</p>

<p>They sat down in the little arbor side by side, but
Theresa would talk and think of nothing but love. Love
was her eternal theme. She heard it among the leaves,
and in the stream that trickled behind the garden. She
heard it in the song of the birds and in the drone of
the bees.</p>

<p>“If you did not love me, Harold, I should die,” she
said. “I could almost wish that the few years you have
forgotten would never return again. Have you ever
heard the Romaic song which tells of the deathless agony
of slighted love? Listen, Harold. Its burden has fascinated
me:</p>

<p>She stopped with a sob, and flung her arms about Sir
Harold’s neck, a passion of tears raining from her eyes.</p>

<p>“Poor little Theresa,” he said, tenderly; “but how
foolish you are to give way to such fears. Am I not
near you—shall I not be ever near to protect you?”</p>

<p>With a long, fluttering sigh, she nestled her head upon
his shoulder and was content.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">SIR HAROLD’S WALK TO FARNWELL.</p>


<p>“Sir Harold,” Mr. Hamilton said, a day or two later,
“I have engaged a woman-servant to live in the house.
She is old and deaf, and will notice nothing in particular
if we simply call you Mr. Harold. I have known her for
some years in connection with the laundry work, and as
her husband is lately dead, she is very glad of a home.
Now that it is settled that Theresa is to be your wife, we
must take better care of her.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you have mentioned this, Mr. Hamilton,”
Sir Harold replied, “because I want to talk with
you about our future. This idle life is growing a little
tiresome, and I should like to travel. Theresa loves me,
and relies upon me so much, that I do not see why the
wedding should be long delayed.”</p>

<p>“She is very young yet,” faltered Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Nineteen—is she not? And I am nearly thirty,
though I have the feelings of a boy,” laughed Sir Harold.
“As the autumn will soon be upon us, I intend asking
your consent to an early marriage, so that the winter may
be spent in Nice, or some similar place. Of course, you
would accompany us if you chose to do so, but I do not
anticipate returning to England until I can take possession
of that which is mine with unimpaired faculties.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, with all my fears and fancies, that I
should be a sort of death’s-head at the feast,” replied
Hamilton, a little mournfully. “I hate parting with my
Theresa, but she is safer with you. As your wife, the
enemy may never suspect whom she really is. If it
pleases you—if it pleases Theresa, my dear boy—I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
agreeable to all that you may do and desire. But for myself,
I shall remain here. I have enough money to buy
the place—the money I have saved for Theresa, and I
think that the evening of my life may be spent in comparative
happiness now that I know my beloved child is
well provided for. Treat her tenderly, Sir Harold, for
she is like a delicate flower, that would droop and die if
neglected or deprived of the sunshine of your love.”</p>

<p>“God helping me, I ever will,” the baronet fervently responded.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued Mr. Hamilton, “what of your
business affairs? Between us—Colonel Greyson and me—everything
can be managed until you feel disposed to
assume the reins of control. I have had a letter from
the colonel to-day. He is in Switzerland, and inquires
anxiously about you. His letter contains news that surprises
me, and we must really try and keep better informed
with that which is happening about us. The
Earl of Seabright recently met with an accident, and is
dead.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” remarked Sir Harold, indifferently. “I endeavored
to become interested in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
you brought home last Saturday, but its very strangeness
bewildered me. I felt like a man who had been asleep
for half a century when I tried to connect the politics I
remembered and the politics of to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of my proposal?” continued
Hamilton; “you will require funds while abroad, and
who so reliable as myself in all that interests you? Besides,
the occupation will be of benefit to me, for when
you and Theresa are gone, I shall be a lonely old man.”</p>

<p>“I am grateful to you,” the young man said, heartily;
“no better arrangement could possibly be made.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you think so, and, as I have a letter of
introduction from the colonel to his London bankers, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
will present it to-day. It is of no use leaving everything
until the last moment, and you will be wanting money
soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the thoughtful rejoinder. “You may draw
a few hundreds on my behalf, and enter into arrangements
with the colonel to let me have five thousand
pounds in a month’s time. I suppose that I have plenty
of funds, and I must make Theresa a handsome wedding
present. You can explain, if you like, that I am going
to be married!”</p>

<p>He laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say,” Mr. Hamilton told him. “And
now, if you will excuse me, Harold, I will go and dress,
as I want to catch an early train. Our new servant will
arrive by and by, and Theresa will look after her.”</p>

<p>An hour later Mr. Hamilton was gone, and after a
little lover-like talk with Theresa, Sir Harold strolled
into the garden. Wet or fine, he rarely was to be found
anywhere else. The low-ceilinged cottage seemed to envelop
him. He could not breathe within its close walls.</p>

<p>There had been a heavy fall of rain in the night, and
the leaves were still dripping, with a sound that irritated
his nerves.</p>

<p>He had been provided with plenty of books and cigars;
but neither afforded him any pleasure now, and he wandered
out of the garden into the lane beyond.</p>

<p>How many weeks had he been confined within the cottage
and its environs? Six or seven? He could not remember
exactly, and now the idea for viewing the country
beyond seized upon him like an inspiration.</p>

<p>If he should chance to meet people who remembered
him, what did it matter? He was a free agent. But
there was little likelihood of that, and he strode away,
interested in every new object that met his view.</p>

<p>When a sense of weariness began to creep over him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
he knew that he must have walked half-a-dozen miles.
He looked at his watch. It was eleven when he left the
cottage, and now the hands pointed to the hour of one.</p>

<p>Half-a-mile away there was a town perched upon the
side of a hill.</p>

<p>“I will get refreshments there,” he thought, “and then
hasten back. Theresa will wonder what has become of
me.”</p>

<p>He went into the town, and pulled his hat over his eyes
like a man who has committed some crime. The people
whom he met stared curiously after him. His was no
common, everyday figure.</p>

<p>At last he turned into a public house, and, walking
into a little parlor, the door of which was held invitingly
open by a trim-looking maid, he called for a glass of ale
and some biscuits.</p>

<p>“This is Farnwell, is it not?” he presently inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the girl.</p>

<p>He was about to express his astonishment at the number
of alterations that had taken place in an amazingly
short space of time, when he remembered his accident.</p>

<p>“I have not been here for a long time,” he explained,
“and everything seems quite strange. Who is the landlord
now?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fletcher, sir.”</p>

<p>“Fletcher? Oh, I do not remember him. I suppose
that the house has recently changed hands?”</p>

<p>“Not for ten years, sir,” the maid replied.</p>

<p>“Of course; I had forgotten my long absence. A very
nice and quiet town, is it not?”</p>

<p>He turned to a newspaper that lay near him, hoping
that the girl would take the hint and retire; but it was not
often that so handsome a gentleman talked to her, and
she endeavored to continue the conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, very quiet,” she said; “rather too quiet to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
liking, sir, though, of course, we do get a bit of sensation
sometimes in connection with the gentry. Now, the best
bit for years is the disappearance of Sir Harold Annesley,
and everybody is talking about it.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Sir Harold, another customer came in,
and he hastily finished his beer.</p>

<p>His thoughts reverted to Theresa, and he regretted
that he had left her without a word about his intentions.</p>

<p>He jumped up, said “Good-morning” to the buxom
maid, and left the house.</p>

<p>He strode rapidly through the town, unaware that he
was being followed by a spare little man, whose face betrayed
emotions of the most violent and complex kind.</p>

<p>Once out of the town, Sir Harold’s long legs took
quicker and longer strides, and the little man began to
run. He panted painfully for a little while, and then
cried:</p>

<p>“Master! Master!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold swung round, and eyed the man wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded. “I am afraid that you have
made some mistake, my good fellow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Sir Harold?” cried the man.
“I’m Stimson, your valet. You left me to go to London,
and I followed the next day with all the luggage, and
have never seen you since.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know you, Stimson; I am very sorry,
and I wish that you had not met me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Harold, I thought that you were dead. I
never did believe what they said about your running away.
I knew you too well.”</p>

<p>“That is what they say, is it?” Sir Harold said. “Well,
I am glad of it. I have no desire to undeceive them,
whoever ‘they’ may be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Stimson stood watching anxiously every expression of
his master’s face.</p>

<p>“I will tell you that which very few people know, Stimson—I
fell from the train at Tenterden on that fatal day,
and had ten years of my life utterly obliterated. That is
why I do not recognize you. I am told that I shall soon
be all right again, and there is only one other of my old
friends in the secret—Colonel Greyson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, master, it is good to hear your voice again!” was
the valet’s hysterical rejoinder. “You want me again,
don’t you, Sir Harold? You said that I should always
remain with you.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to keep my word, Stimson, because I am
really in need of a valet. I am to be married soon, and
intend going abroad immediately, to stay until my memory
is fully restored.”</p>

<p>The valet stared at him doubtfully, and blankly said:</p>

<p>“Married, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to the daughter of the man who saved my intellect,
if not my life. I never want you to refer to the
past, Stimson. That is over and done with—at least, that
portion which brought me so much sorrow. I understand
that I was infatuated with a cold-hearted, beautiful
flirt, who is engaged to some other fellow already.
There, that is done with. You may accompany me now,
but I rely upon your absolute secrecy. I am not staying
far from here, and you will be very useful, for my
wardrobe is limited to what I have on my back!”</p>

<p>“The luggage is still at the London hotel, Sir Harold,
and I waited there for you until I was penniless. Shall
I fetch it away?” the valet asked.</p>

<p>“We will talk about that later, as I wish to arouse no
suspicion. To everybody, for a time, I am to be plain Mr.
Harold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, master; I shall not forget,” the half-hysterical
Stimson replied.</p>

<p>Theresa was watching for her lover, and the dark rings
under her eyes told of the anxiety she had endured.</p>

<p>The appearance of a stranger frightened her, and Sir
Harold drew her aside, whispering:</p>

<p>“Poor little girl! How thoughtless of me to leave you
so long without one word of explanation. But I did not
intend going so far, Theresa, and then, my old valet
recognized me, and I have engaged him to go with us on
our wedding tour. I can see that he is trustworthy, and
he is half-frantic with joy. Is there room for him in
this little nest? If not, we must find him lodgings somewhere
until we go away.”</p>

<p>“I think that we can manage, Harold,” Theresa said,
happy tears standing in her eyes. “Oh, I was so frightened
when I could not find you. I am always dreaming
that I have lost you!”</p>

<p>“There is not much fear of that, darling,” he said,
laughingly, and pressing a kiss to her lips.</p>

<p>By the time Mr. Hamilton returned from London a
room had been put to rights for the valet, the resources
of the cottage being taxed to their utmost.</p>

<p>The visit to the metropolis had been successful in every
way, and the evening was spent in writing a somewhat
lengthy letter to Colonel Greyson, wherein Sir Harold’s
arrangements for the immediate future were fully set
forth.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Sir Harold retired, and
he wished Hamilton an affectionate “Good-night!” saying,
“You have overdone yourself to-day. Do not sit up
too long.”</p>

<p>“No, Harold; I have a few old papers to destroy. I
shall not be many minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>The young man went up to his room, which was
directly over the one in which he had left Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>For a little while he heard the rustling of papers, then
a sudden silence, followed by the opening of a door.</p>

<p>Five—ten minutes passed, and there was not a sound.</p>

<p>Slipping into his clothes again, Sir Harold stepped
downstairs, and Mr. Hamilton was apparently asleep.
The young man spoke to him, but there was no reply.
Then he ran and shook him. The head dropped forward,
and one glance revealed that he was dead—the
hanging lower jaw, the glazing eyes, filled with unutterable
horror, and the stiffening hands.</p>

<p>“My God!” gasped Sir Harold. “Poor Theresa!”</p>

<p>He lifted the poor old man to a sofa, and a scrap of
paper dropped from the nerveless fingers, bearing these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tracked at last, Lambert Egerton, assassin of the Count Crispi,
of blessed memory. It is useless to evade us longer. Your doom
is sealed! Your life and the life of the child of the false Theresa
Ludovci are demanded by the Brotherhood. Blood for
blood! Prepare, for at any moment the avenger may be upon
you! You are spared a little longer, so that you may understand
the tortures of the doomed!</p>
</div>

<p>The writing was a mere scrawl, and the spelling and
grammar proclaimed the author to be an illiterate
foreigner.</p>

<p>For a minute Sir Harold stared at the paper aghast,
then darting through the open doorway, he plunged into
the garden in quest of the man or woman the shock of
whose presence had deprived Mr. Hamilton of life.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A FUNERAL AND A WEDDING.</p>


<p>In every bush, and tree, and lurking shadow the young
baronet probed, but without avail. The evil messenger
was gone, and he now had to break the awful news to
poor Theresa.</p>

<p>He stood for a few minutes with his hands clasped to
his throbbing temples. Then he hurried back to the cottage,
and after taking one hasty glance about him, his
first care was to destroy the fatal scrawl.</p>

<p>This much accomplished, he crept softly to Stimson’s
room, hastily roused the man, and sent him for the nearest
doctor.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton is dead,” he whispered to the horrified
valet; “has died of heart failure! To me it was not unexpected,
as he predicted it only a few days since; but we
must have the independent opinion of a doctor to save
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Harold. I know Tenterden very well. The
parish doctor lives next door to the rectory,” Stimson
said.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was gone, and Sir Harold was confronted
by the awkwardness of his position. There was
only one thing for him to do now, and that was to marry
Theresa at once. He would be then her natural and lawful
protector.</p>

<p>“Stimson shall call upon the rector of Tenterden,” he
decided, “and I will interview him here. I see no reason
why I should hide my identity. Let people think and say
what they will. No, I will be married as Sir Harold Annesley
immediately after the funeral, and we will go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
abroad at once! As for this accursed vendetta, I will
leave no stone unturned to bring the fiends to justice!”</p>

<p>The doctor came and viewed the body. He was satisfied
that death was the result of heart disease. He listened
to the relation of Mr. Hamilton’s unusual exertions during
the day, and was satisfied. An ordinary certificate
would be promptly granted.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Sir Harold and Stimson carried the
body upstairs, and laid it on the bed wherein Mr. Hamilton
had slept for many years.</p>

<p>Then the house became silent again, and Theresa was
sleeping, a happy smile upon her face and Sir Harold’s
name upon her lips.</p>

<p>The morning broke dull and gray. There was a wet
mist everywhere, and the birds that loved to carol in the
sunshine were voiceless.</p>

<p>The deaf servant came downstairs at an early hour, and
was surprised to find Sir Harold already about and talking
earnestly to his man.</p>

<p>When Theresa appeared, she noticed the worn look
upon her lover’s face, and he took her gently aside.</p>

<p>“You are not well, Harold!” she said in sudden alarm.
“You have heard bad news!”</p>

<p>“Theresa, my poor Theresa, I have heard bad news,
and I know not how best to tell it to you.”</p>

<p>He felt that he was blundering, and his heart smote
him when her face blanched deathly white.</p>

<p>“My dear little girl,” he said, “come to my arms and
let me hold you tight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harold, what is this that is coming upon us?
Tell me that I am not to lose you!”</p>

<p>“Never, darling, never! You are the sweetest charge
that man ever had. You shall never leave me, Theresa!”</p>

<p>“But this trouble—this bad news. Oh, Harold, do not
torture me!” she sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Theresa, cannot you guess? Your father is an old
man and——”</p>

<p>“Ah! my father is ill! My poor, dear father. Let me
go to him, Harold. Take me to him now.”</p>

<p>He led her to the chamber of the dead man, but paused
at the door, saying:</p>

<p>“Theresa, he will never speak again. He died last
night, and the doctor has already been here.”</p>

<p>He never forgot the faint moan that left her anguished
heart. For an instant she reeled, then glided into the
death chamber, and kissed the cold face, her eyes tearless,
her breath hot almost as a furnace.</p>

<p>After this she did not speak for a long time, but was
never far from her lover.</p>

<p>Stimson was very busy all day, and several strange
men moved about the house. The funeral was to be hurried.
Sir Harold had strong reasons for this. He
wanted it over and done with, and both the rector and the
doctor were of the same opinion when he had explained
his somewhat anomalous position.</p>

<p>The clergyman was deeply interested in his story. He
had heard of Sir Harold Annesley, and while he believed
that it was wise to go abroad immediately after the marriage,
he did not quite approve of so much secrecy.</p>

<p>“It is an extraordinary experience,” he said, “and the
reawakening will be a mental shock, Sir Harold. I once
read of an accident to a bricklayer—some heavy substance
was dropped down and struck his head, utterly destroying
his memory. He fancied he was a child again. Twenty
years elapsed before he recovered one month of what he
had forgotten. His case was similar to yours in many
respects, only that he remained in the care of his friends.
Have you no one—no lady friend—-who you could send
for? Miss Hamilton needs some one, Sir Harold. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
a fond lover cannot supply all wants. A little womanly
sympathy from one who is related to you would be a
real blessing to the lonely child in this trying hour.”</p>

<p>“I can think of no one, except my cousin, Margaret Nugent.
I do not remember much of her, but my valet says
that we were good friends until the last—that Miss Nugent
was with me within an hour of my leaving Annesley
Park.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” the rector said, rubbing his hands briskly
together. “Now, with your permission, Sir Harold, I will
run down to Ashbourne and see Miss Nugent. It is a
duty you owe to her to let her know something of your
true position, and if you have confidence in my tact, I will
undertake to prepare her carefully, and see that no one
else hears one word of the story.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold hesitated a moment, then he said: “I am
very grateful to you, Mr. Pembrose, and accept your kind
offer. I clearly see that Theresa will be the better for it.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Pembrose went to Craythorne that very day,
and in the afternoon Margaret Nugent arrived at the cottage.</p>

<p>Her first thought was that an objection to the marriage
might be raised, but when she had seen Theresa and
talked with Sir Harold, she knew that such a proceeding
was quite beyond her control.</p>

<p>“You have become a very beautiful woman, Margaret,”
he said, “and you and I were always good friends. I
shall never forget this kindness. I suppose that the rector
has told you all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Harold.”</p>

<p>Her lips were hot and dry, and there was a look of
unutterable longing in her eyes. It seemed that all her
scheming and wrongdoing had been in vain. She was to
lose him, after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“There is one other thing that you must know, so that
you may guard my Theresa with greater care.”</p>

<p>He bent closer.</p>

<p>“Listen, Margaret, and you shall hear that which must
be forever locked in your heart—the story of an infamous
vendetta. I would not have Theresa know one word of
it for all that life is worth.”</p>

<p>He then told her the story that he had heard from Mr.
Hamilton, and the final cause of the old man’s sudden
death.</p>

<p>“And these assassins may be near us now?” she whispered.
“Oh, Harold, it is terrible!”</p>

<p>“As my wife, Theresa may lose her identity. I shall
guard her with constant care, and if I can succeed in making
an example of one of the fiends, I will show him no
mercy!”</p>

<p>For hours after this recital Margaret Nugent was very
thoughtful, and her face was not pleasant to look upon.</p>

<p>The funeral of John Hamilton took place the next day,
and when the last sad rites had been administered to the
dead, Sir Harold gently told Theresa of his wishes concerning
an immediate marriage.</p>

<p>“As my wife, darling, I can care for you, and shield
you from every storm. I have made all arrangements
for the wedding to take place next Tuesday, and, in the
meantime, my Cousin Margaret will advise you concerning
the clothing you will require, and other matters of
which a man knows nothing. We will leave the servant
woman in charge of the cottage, and go to London.
There a suitable maid can be engaged and our tour begun.”</p>

<p>“If it pleases you, Harold, I shall be content,” Theresa
said, pitifully. “The pain is still big at my heart, and
now you are my all in all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, continuing:</p>

<p>“And after the wedding Miss Nugent is willing to
remain with us until we are ready to go abroad. I am
sure you must find her assistance and sympathy of great
value.”</p>

<p>“I had rather she left us after the wedding day, Harold,”
Theresa said. “I do not think she really likes me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Why should you think so?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Harold. Still, I cannot get rid of the
feeling.”</p>

<p>There was a quiet little wedding a few days later at
Tenterden Church, and in the afternoon the bride and
bridegroom left for London, accompanied by Miss Nugent
and Stimson, the valet.</p>

<p>A splendid suite of apartments was engaged at the
Victoria Hotel, and Margaret was of great help to Theresa.</p>

<p>“You must try to like me a little, Theresa,” she said,
when they were alone for a few minutes. “I felt disappointed
at first, because I did not believe that Harold
could really know his own mind. And then, you know,
Lady Elaine Seabright is a very dear friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“But she was unworthy of my darling!” Theresa replied,
quickly. “I do not wish to hear her name again!”</p>

<p>“No! no! my dear! It was all a misunderstanding,
though, of course, it would never do to tell Sir Harold
now! Lady Elaine loves him still; indeed, she is somewhere
in London, and I dread a meeting between her
and my cousin.”</p>

<p>There was a wicked light in Margaret’s downcast eyes
when she noted the deadly pallor of Theresa’s lovely face.</p>

<p>“Why should you tell me these things?” she said, piteously.
“Ah, Lady Elaine never loved Sir Harold as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
love him! He has told me many times that I am all the
world to him!”</p>

<p>“But when his memory returns, Theresa,” Margaret
said, “you must be prepared.”</p>

<p>And every word she uttered was as painful as a knife-thrust
in poor Theresa’s heart.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE AWAKENING BEGINS.</p>


<p>Although Margaret Nugent had strongly advocated as
short a stay in London as possible, she placed every obstacle
in the way of the Annesleys’ speedy departure.</p>

<p>“Theresa is so young, so inexperienced,” Sir Harold
had told her, “that I leave the engagement of her maid in
your hands unreservedly.”</p>

<p>So Miss Nugent had sent advertisements to the newspapers,
and entered into correspondence with a dozen or
more ladies desiring the post of maid to Lady Annesley,
but there appeared to be something wrong with them all.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sir Harold devoted himself assiduously
to his beautiful young wife. Her pale face, almost
listless manner and heavy eyes were a source of constant
uneasiness to him.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he said one morning, “you must not
dwell so much upon the grief that has been caused by
the loss of your poor father. I cannot afford to have my
little one fade before my eyes in this way.”</p>

<p>“I shall be better when we are out of London, Harold,”
Theresa said. “I have heard of the cruel things that go
on daily in this great city, and I am afraid.”</p>

<p>It was a strange speech, and he glanced at her keenly.</p>

<p>“Afraid of what, Theresa?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, afraid of losing you!”</p>

<p>He laughed now. The idea was so utterly absurd.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” he said, “do you imagine that I shall be
kidnaped? Poor, imaginative Theresa! While this
seemingly interminable business of engaging a maid is in
progress, you shall accompany me everywhere I go. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
quite expected that we should have been in France by this
time. Colonel Greyson has arranged with me to meet us
in Paris.”</p>

<p>“I wish that we could start to-night, Harold,” Theresa
said.</p>

<p>“And I echo that wish, darling. Do you know if Margaret
has yet decided upon a suitable person?”</p>

<p>“No, Harold; I think that we might have managed our
affairs much better alone. For some reason, Miss Nugent
wishes to delay our departure. She objects to haste of
any kind.”</p>

<p>“It is only because she feels the responsibility of suiting
you in every way, Theresa,” Sir Harold hastened to
assure her. “I think that Margaret has been very kind
to us.”</p>

<p>Theresa shuddered.</p>

<p>“I do not like her, Harold,” she said. “It may seem
a silly prejudice, but I cannot get rid of the feeling that
your cousin is our enemy.”</p>

<p>For a moment Sir Harold was inclined to anger. An
exclamation of impatience escaped him, and the young
wife never forgot his look of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Theresa, I cannot listen to such folly. Margaret Nugent
our enemy? Why should she be our enemy? It is
unjust—cruel!”</p>

<p>He turned and left her, and Theresa shed bitter tears.
But in one minute he was back again, and soothing her
with tender words and caresses.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, dear one,” he cried. “I spoke hastily,
and I am sorry. I will speak to Margaret, and we will
not wait for the maid if it is so difficult to find a suitable
one. The bustle and whirl of the streets makes me irritable,
and lately I have suffered excruciating pains in
my head at times. It annoys me when I am accosted by
people of whom I know nothing, and this occurred twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
yesterday. Fortunately, this is the time of year when
London is comparatively empty, or I should be afraid to
go out at all. I believe that my memory will soon assume
its proper functions,” he added, reflectively. “I distinctly
remember many things this morning which have been a
blank.”</p>

<p>She clutched at his arm in sudden terror.</p>

<p>“It will be better if we leave London soon, Harold,”
she said. “A maid can be picked up anywhere, and as
I have never been used to the luxury, the loss will not
cause me any inconvenience. I dread that you may be
discovered here by old friends, who will make you forget
me!”</p>

<p>He kissed away her tears, and she added, plaintively:</p>

<p>“I should like to live in my mother’s country, Harold.
You cannot think how I long to see the blue skies of
Italy.”</p>

<p>He shuddered a little, and replied, huskily:</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, Theresa! It is only natural. Now I will
speak to Margaret, and this very night we will shake the
dust of London from our feet!”</p>

<p>She seemed greatly relieved, and smiled at him through
her tears, murmuring:</p>

<p>“How good you are to me, my husband, and how selfish
I am!”</p>

<p>“The duty of my life, Theresa, is to love and care
for you,” he said. “I believe that Margaret is at the door—yes;
and I will speak to her now.”</p>

<p>They were in a private sitting-room, and Miss Nugent’s
voice was asking if she might enter.</p>

<p>For reply, Sir Harold opened the door, and Margaret
saw at once that something was wrong.</p>

<p>“I hope that I am not intruding,” she remarked,
sweetly. “Dear Theresa is not well?”</p>

<p>“No, Margaret. Lady Annesley is naturally upset by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
her recent bereavement, and the bustle of busy London is
too much for her. I purpose going away to-night, maid
or no maid, and you must not take this sudden decision
unkindly.”</p>

<p>“My dear cousin! how can you speak so? I am here
for your pleasure alone,” Miss Nugent said.</p>

<p>“I believe you, Margaret,” replied Sir Harold. “And
now I will leave you two together while I hunt up Stimson
and give him imperative orders. I shall probably
go for a last stroll also.”</p>

<p>He kissed Theresa tenderly, and Margaret saw the
action with jealous anger.</p>

<p>“He is very fond of you, Theresa,” she observed, when
her cousin was gone; “but you must not be too exacting;
he is already sacrificing so much for you. I suppose
that it is your wish to fly from London because of
Lady Elaine Seabright, and I am pleased that you think
so well of my advice.”</p>

<p>“I do not care to discuss the matter,” Lady Annesley
said, coldly. “In all things I wish to please my husband.”</p>

<p>“You do not like me, my lady,” was Margaret’s next
shaft. “I know that you do not like me. Why is it?”</p>

<p>“Because you are not my friend. A woman’s instincts
rarely err!” Theresa replied.</p>

<p>“I like your candor,” Margaret laughed, a little bitterly,
“but it is a poor return for my efforts to warn you against
the shipwreck of this love of yours. You profess to love
my cousin, but it is a selfish love. It is this which makes
me doubt you.”</p>

<p>“You speak in riddles, Miss Nugent,” Theresa said,
angrily. “I would willingly lay down my life for my husband.
My love is richer than pearls or rubies. For his
sake I would willingly walk barefooted through life. I
would even renounce my hopes of heaven!”</p>

<p>“It sounds very nice, truly,” was the sneering rejoinder;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
“and yet because of you he carries his life in his
hand. Do you wonder that I do not fall into raptures
over such a sacrifice? Blood is thicker than water, Lady
Annesley. You affect not to understand me, when you
must well know that you and yours for all time are the
victims of a secret vendetta. Your countrymen know how
to hate and to stab in the dark. Your father stole another
man’s bride, and the shadow of the knife for this
act killed your mother. In fear Mr. Hamilton buried
himself in the country to escape the fate that was sure
to follow sooner or later. The executive of the vendetta
visited him the night he died!”</p>

<p>“No—no!” gasped Theresa, terrified beyond mere
words.</p>

<p>“Why will you seek to deceive yourself?” continued
Miss Nugent, vindictively. “You know that it is true—you
also know that Sir Harold, as your husband, is a
marked man. He may be stabbed to death at any moment.
Do you think that I, his cousin, can love you,
knowing the ban that his alliance with you has placed
upon him? We English do not understand these things.
It is revolting.”</p>

<p>Lady Annesley was lying back, deathly white. It
seemed that all the beauty of the early September morning
had suddenly been enveloped by a black ball.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” she whispered, hoarsely. “Yes, my
heart tells me that it is true!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that it is news to you?” demanded
Margaret, with well-assumed astonishment. “Oh, Theresa,
if it is so, you must not tell Sir Harold, or he will
never forgive me. Promise that you will not tell him!”</p>

<p>“Swear that you have not lied to me, and I promise,”
Theresa said.</p>

<p>“Before Heaven, every word is truth, and I could cut
out my tongue for having spoken it. Sir Harold himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
destroyed the written warning from the executive
which threatened his own life. Oh, Lady Annesley, I
shall never forgive myself for what I have done!”</p>

<p>“Leave me, Margaret Nugent. I never wish to look
upon your face again. I hate you!”</p>

<p>Theresa rose, with heaving bosom and flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Go,” she continued, pointing to the door. “Upon
that condition only will I keep silence. You have this
day dealt me a blow that will be my death!”</p>

<p>Half-frightened, Miss Nugent left the room, and an
hour later she quitted the hotel, leaving as an excuse the
following, addressed to Sir Harold:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harold</span>—An urgent telegram from mamma, who is an
invalid, obliges me to run down to Ashbourne at once. Let me
know of your movements, and always count upon my help if you
need it. I have said good-by to Theresa.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="salutation">Your affectionate cousin,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Margaret Nugent</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>In the meanwhile, Annesley had given his orders to
Stimson, and gone to Coutts’ Bank to transact some financial
business on behalf of Colonel Greyson, from whom
he had received various drafts and letters of credit.</p>

<p>While standing at the counter, a gentleman had placed
his hand familiarly upon his shoulder and ejaculated:</p>

<p>“Great heavens! Is that you, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p>“You really have the advantage of me, sir,” replied the
baronet, with a cold stare.</p>

<p>“Come, come; this will not do,” the stranger continued.
“You may wish to hide your identity from most people,
but when you try that on with your lawyer and man of
business, I think that it is time to draw the line! To
refresh your memory, Sir Harold,” a little sarcastically,
“my name is Babbet, of the firm of Babbet &amp; Co., and
as you have not removed the management of your affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
from our hands, I naturally suppose that you continue to
have confidence in us. Of course, we are in communication
with Colonel Greyson.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold suddenly put his hands to his head, and
reeled like a drunken man. His face turned deathly
white.</p>

<p>“Ah, I recognize you, Babbet!” he gasped, “but the
effort was awful. I have been ill, you know. Let me
have fresh air.”</p>

<p>The lawyer led him to the door, much concerned, and
walked with him toward Charing Cross.</p>

<p>“You will see me again before leaving London?” he
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will endeavor to do so,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that you are able to proceed alone?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Sir Harold. “My hotel is near.”</p>

<p>They parted, but Annesley did not go to his hotel. He
felt utterly bewildered, and walked in the direction of
Hyde Park, where he seated himself, and bared his hot
brow to the cool September breeze.</p>

<p>“It is all so strange, and yet so familiar,” he kept murmuring.
“I cannot make it out at all. I must not delay;
Theresa will be waiting for me. Poor little Theresa! I
am married to Theresa—or is it a dream? I am on my
wedding tour, of course, but I hope that I am not going
to be ill. Oh, that cruel knife is ever present! My poor
little Theresa!”</p>

<p>He saw that two persons were approaching, and he replaced
his hat. The figures were those of ladies, but they
appeared to be misty and far away. He wished that they
would go on, so that he could be alone. Then he was
conscious that one of them gave utterance to a half-stifled
scream, and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my lady! my lady! it is Sir Harold himself!”</p>

<p>Again that awful throbbing made him dizzy, and he
saw before him the face of an angel.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” he whispered, hoarsely, “am I dreaming,
or is it the face of my false love, Lady Elaine?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE VILLA IN HYDE PARK.</p>


<p>The subtle, insinuating manner of Viscount Rivington
completely deceived Lady Elaine. Open and honest as
the sunshine of day, it was impossible for her mind to
descend to the lower plane wherein his schemes had birth.</p>

<p>He accompanied her and her maid to London, and saw
them comfortably quartered at an hotel. He it was who
elected next day to escort Lady Elaine to the office of
Mr. Worboys. He had no desire to know anything of
her business with the old family lawyer, and he remained
in the waiting-room without.</p>

<p>In truth, it was but a formal call, and at first Mr. Worboys
waited expectantly to hear what Lady Elaine had to
say.</p>

<p>She told him briefly of her quarrel with Lady Gaynor
and Viscount Rivington’s unexpected help and sympathy.</p>

<p>“You can trust him?” questioned the lawyer. “Do not
blind yourself to possible ulterior motives.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine flushed slightly.</p>

<p>“The Viscount thoroughly understands that all hope in
that direction—in the direction of an alliance between us—is
at an end. He has even been generous enough to
hint that I shall ultimately be no loser by my father’s eccentric
will.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you surprise me, Lady Elaine; indeed you do.
I am astonished that any man can so easily relinquish
so great a prize as yourself and a princely income—particularly
when that man is so needy as Viscount Rivington.
It is not generally known, but within the last three
months the Viscount’s name has been filed in bankruptcy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
by importunate creditors, and he has only escaped a receiving
order by very doubtful practices. He has made
known the contents of your father’s will to several money
lenders for pecuniary reasons purely, and his marriage
with you means, at least, social salvation to him. You
wonder how these things come to my ears? My dear
child, a lawyer gets such knowledge without any seeking.
I only say, be careful of Viscount Rivington.”</p>

<p>“I am deeply sorry for him if all this is true,” Lady
Elaine said.</p>

<p>“And now as to your future movements,” went on Mr.
Worboys.</p>

<p>“Yes. My maid and I will rent a small house somewhere
in the suburbs—until—until——”</p>

<p>“I understand what you mean. Until something lucky
happens, eh?” he smiled. “Well, it appears to me that I
can do little or nothing for you, Lady Elaine, but remember
that I am always at your service. Let me know where
you reside when you are settled, and if you require a
small advance for furniture or anything of that kind,
don’t go to any one else.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Worboys; you are extremely kind,
but I have a reserve fund amounting to a few hundreds.”</p>

<p>A little later the old lawyer bowed my lady out, and
Viscount Rivington escorted her back to her hotel.</p>

<p>The next few days were so full of busy hours that Lady
Elaine almost forgot her pitiful lot. The viscount managed
to secure a bijou villa within half a mile of Hyde
Park. It was a pretty little place, set in an acre of garden,
and the whole was surrounded by a high brick wall.
To add to its advantage, the villa was already furnished,
and the agent who let it to the viscount proudly announced
that the last occupant had been a Russian prince.</p>

<p>“I have taken it in my own name,” he explained to
Elaine, “to save the bother of references and the needless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
exposure consequent upon such a course. You have no
idea how loth people are to have responsible business
transactions exclusively with ladies. I have paid the rent
three months in advance—a matter of fifty guineas, which
includes all rates and taxes—so that you will not be bothered
by anybody. Here is the key to the house. Now I
am leaving London for a week or two to join some
friends in Scotland, but if you require anything at my
hands, a telegram will promptly bring me back.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine did not quite like the arrangement, but it
was perhaps the best that could be made under the circumstances.
It almost appeared that she and her maid
were living in a house to which Viscount Rivington alone
had legal right. However, she paid him the amount of
money he claimed to have disbursed upon her account,
and thanked him warmly for the great trouble he had
taken in all matters concerning herself.</p>

<p>“I do not think that I shall willingly trespass further
upon your kindness,” she told him. “My life is already
mapped out, and I shall be content to spend it quietly between
the four walls of yonder garden until hope breaks
through the dark clouds of the future.”</p>

<p>“Time will dull the edge of your sorrow,” he said, gently,
but with a sense of bitter defeat gnawing at his heart.
Her very words, the mournful sadness in her tones,
sounded the death knell to his hopes. “You cannot live
here always—you, the loveliest girl in England—the
daughter of an earl! Oh, Lady Elaine, it is impossible!”</p>

<p>He spoke almost passionately.</p>

<p>“I have no other choice—no other wish—until my lover
comes back to me,” she said.</p>

<p>The viscount turned away to hide the disappointment—the
fury in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” he said, suddenly. “I will send you my address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
to your new home in a few days. You will take
possession at once?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” replied Lady Elaine. “Nina is engaging
a servant to-day.”</p>

<p>He went away—a raging demon in his heart.</p>

<p>“Lady Gaynor was right,” he said to himself. “Force
and questionable means must be employed or I am a
ruined man! But I have my bird safely caged. She
cannot escape me; she shall not, by Heaven! Now have
I to conciliate the vampires who seek for my heart’s
blood—to prove to them that Lady Elaine is under my
protection—living in my house. I know that I no longer
belong to myself, and that my life is a living death—all
for what?—Money! Money! And when I have humbled
myself to these birds of prey, whose talons are red with
the blood of human hearts, I have to turn toward that old
dotard—the Duke of Rothwell, and lie and fawn to him—for
what?—Money! Money!”</p>

<p>He ground his teeth with impotent fury, sprang into a
cab, and ordered the driver to take him to Oxford Circus,
where we will leave him.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days Lady Elaine Seabright
was comfortably installed in her new home, and then
commenced a weary time of waiting. Two or three of
the curious-minded neighbors called at the villa, but she
declined to see them. The efforts of the clergyman who
claimed that respective district were equally futile, and
nearly three weeks passed without one word from Viscount
Rivington.</p>

<p>Then a letter reached her from the Duke of Rothwell’s
country seat. The viscount professed that he had been
unable to go to Scotland on account of his uncle’s indisposition.
She made no reply to this, and appeared to be
growing thinner and whiter every day to the eyes of the
watchful Nina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“My lady,” she said at last, “I am getting frightened.
It is killing you in this stifling place. You ought to go
for a morning walk every day.”</p>

<p>“Am I really looking ill, Nina?” asked Lady Elaine,
listlessly. “Yes,” she added, looking at herself in a mirror.
“What a miserable being I shall be when my lover
comes home! This will never do, Nina!”</p>

<p>After that Elaine and Nina were often seen in the park,
and many people wondered whom the graceful and lovely
girl could be.</p>

<p>At length another letter came from the viscount, and
with it a newspaper.</p>

<p>This is what he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Lady Elaine</span>—I have news for you which you may
hate me for sending, but I must honestly confess that I cannot
withhold it, for the very reason that it may influence you to look
more favorably upon the wishes that are still dearest to my
heart. Surely my patience deserves some recognition, and I
shall wait in a fever of anxiety for your reply. To be brief, it
is proven beyond all doubt that Sir Harold Annesley has been
masquerading about the country for some time, and his eccentricities
have culminated in his marriage to a young and beautiful
girl, named Theresa Hamilton. The ceremony took place a
few days since at Tenterden Church, and I forward to you a
copy of the <i>Telegraph</i>, containing a description of the wedding.
I do not wish to force my attentions upon you, but I ask you
to give me hope. I care not if it is months before I may look
to the happy consummation of my soul’s delightful desire. I
only want hope, after your most careful consideration. I love
you, and shall ever love you! Till death, yours alone,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Rivington</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Elaine read this extraordinary letter with the
numbness of an awful despair at her heart. Hope! how
could he dream of hope?</p>

<p>Then she opened the newspaper, and saw a paragraph
ruled round with red ink that looked like blood.</p>

<p>It was true then—all true! She sat for an hour dimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
comprehending the fact that life was at last ended for
her. Sir Harold was her lover no longer! Sir Harold—her
darling, her king—belonged to another!</p>

<p>She mechanically penned a few words to the viscount,
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your letter has filled me with pain. I thought that you understood.
I can give you no hope—absolutely none. I shall never
marry. My love has been given, and is lost. My heart is dead.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Elaine Seabright.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>She told nothing of the crushing facts to Nina until
the next day, when they went for their usual walk in
Hyde Park, and the girl listened in wonderment and with
righteous indignation.</p>

<p>The letter to the viscount was posted, and they were
returning homeward, when Nina noticed the figure of a
man that seemed to be familiar, reclining on one of the
park benches.</p>

<p>When they came nearer to him, the girl’s eyes dilated
wildly and she screamed loudly:</p>

<p>“Oh, my lady! my lady! It is Sir Harold himself!”</p>

<p>Then Lady Elaine forgot the news of his marriage, and
cast herself at his feet in a paroxysm of tears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“TO-MORROW SHALL DECIDE.”</p>


<p>It was a trying moment—a moment never to be forgotten
by Sir Harold and Lady Elaine—never to be forgotten
by Nina, who was looking helplessly on.</p>

<p>“Not false, Harold—not false to you in word or deed!”
cried Lady Elaine. “Oh, my dear love, why did you
doubt me? Why were you so cruel?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” he whispered. “I am not yet quite clear as to
your meaning. My brain is on fire. Let me think—think!
All this is so strange. You do not know what has
happened—you—oh! the pain is maddening! I cannot
bear it!”</p>

<p>In an instant my lady was on her feet, in her eyes a
look of infinite love and pity.</p>

<p>“I know that there is now an impassable barrier between
us, Sir Harold,” she said, “and that it is wrong
for me to even speak to you upon familiar terms. Do not
think that I shall forget my duty.”</p>

<p>He held out his hands blindly, saying:</p>

<p>“I must see you again, Elaine—my lost darling! Theresa
is waiting for me—poor Theresa. I will come to
the park another day, when my head pains me less.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with her and staggered away. The
forgotten past was passing before him like a dream within
a dream.</p>

<p>He never knew how he reached the hotel. He had
lost all count of time and space; his eyes were bloodshot,
his lips and tongue parched and dry.</p>

<p>He was late, and Theresa met him with tear-stained
cheeks and hollow eyes. At sight of his haggard face her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
thoughts immediately fled to the story that Margaret Nugent
had told her—the story of the vendetta.</p>

<p>“Harold, dear Harold, my husband,” she cried, “you
are ill!”</p>

<p>He pushed her from him, but the next instant turned to
comfort her.</p>

<p>“Yes, little one, I am ill, and I wish that I might die!
What sin is mine that my misery should be so great that
others should be cursed by the relentless fate that pursues
me? Theresa, poor little confiding Theresa! Do
not look at me in that way, dear one. I will shield you
from every threatening storm. You will not be disappointed,
Theresa, but we cannot leave London until to-morrow
night. I have not completed my business yet;
I have arranged for one more interview with—with an
old friend.”</p>

<p>She noted his hesitation, and a pang shot through her
heart.</p>

<p>“Is it imperative, Harold?” she asked. “I hate London
so much—I hate it for your sake, darling. The hum
that ever sounds in my ears sings of strife and woe, and
every strange footstep fills me with undefinable terrors.”</p>

<p>“Silly girl!” he said, pettishly. “Ah, my brain is surely
bursting! Send that footman away!”</p>

<p>“Footman, Harold? There is no one in the room except
ourselves!” she cried, clinging to him tightly.</p>

<p>He laughed a hollow laugh, and reeled toward his bedroom,
uttering wild words.</p>

<p>“Who is this,” he said, “that dares stand between me
and freedom? Who has robbed me of my love of my life?
Oh, cursed is my fate!”</p>

<p>A doctor was sent for, and Sir Harold was pronounced
to be in a high state of fever. A sedative was administered,
and the medical man would give no decided opinion
as to the malignancy of the attack. For two days he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
raved of many things, appealing by turns to Lady Elaine
and his young wife for protection against some mysterious
and dreaded phantom, and Theresa drank in
every word—drank them in one by one—poison drops
that crowded her soul with a hopeless misery more bitter
than death.</p>

<p>On the sixth day he was pronounced out of danger.
The fever had in reality only been a passing attack, and
his first rational words were a demand for his wife.</p>

<p>“Theresa,” he said, softly, “is it not annoying that I
should become ill so soon after our wedding? But I
shall soon be all right again, dear one, and we will leave
England, perhaps forever. I hate it now!”</p>

<p>“And why do you hate England?” his wife asked, with
a look in her eyes that made him feel uneasy. “Would
you have hated your country if we had never met, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Have I been talking some nonsense in my delirium?”
was his quick demand. “Oh, Theresa, you must forget
every word of it! Kiss me, little wife! and let me see
the happy smile of old upon your sweet face! Do you
remember how happy we were in the little garden at
Tenterden, with its wonderland of flowers and nooks, its
singing birds and humming bees?”</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t, my husband!” she sobbed. “Those
blessed days are passed. They were but an illusive
dream. If we were back again in the cottage, and things
were just the same as then, without knowledge of the
cruel world beyond, how sweet to die, with my head on
your breast!”</p>

<p>He could not understand these strange words or the
hopeless look in her eyes, and he watched for Stimson
with an anxiety that was painful.</p>

<p>At last the valet was alone with him, and Sir Harold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
spoke quickly: “You have attended me during my fever,
have you not, Stimson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, master.”</p>

<p>“Have I talked much? Out with it, man! Why was
my wife permitted to remain at my bedside?”</p>

<p>“She insisted, Sir Harold, upon watching over you.
You have talked rather wildly about Lady Elaine Seabright,
the shadow of a knife, and other equally foolish
things.”</p>

<p>For a minute Annesley was silent. His thoughts were
perplexed.</p>

<p>“Stimson,” he said at last, “my mind is now as clear as
possible. I am not quite sure, though, whether or not I
met Lady Elaine in Hyde Park the same day that I was
taken ill. It may have been a dream, and I want you to
find out the truth.”</p>

<p>“You did meet Lady Elaine, Sir Harold. Her maid
has called twice to inquire about you. Lady Annesley is
not aware of it, though.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold groaned.</p>

<p>“Stimson, there has been some horrible mistake. I
must see Lady Elaine for a few minutes, and then leave
England forever. My duty is toward my loving, trusting
wife.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Harold, I have Lady Elaine’s address. I
send her news of your condition daily. I may have done
wrong, but——”</p>

<p>“Hush, Stimson! Not another word! I rely upon you
completely.”</p>

<p>The valet understood, and three days later he bore a
message to Lady Elaine Seabright, which read in this
way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Lost Love</span>—To-morrow night I shall leave England forever.
Before doing so, I must see you once more, if only to
vindicate myself in your eyes. I have a wife who is devoted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
me heart and soul, and, God helping me, I will do my duty
toward her. At three o’clock to-morrow afternoon I shall arrive
at your address. Do not deny me this last farewell.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Harold.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Elaine shed tears over this missive, and replied
simply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is wrong, but I cannot deny you. Heaven forgive me!</p>
</div>

<p>The very knowledge of his disloyalty to his wife increased
his tenderness toward her. He called her by
many pet names, and spoke in glowing terms of the
brightness of their future, but she only smiled in a sad,
sweet way, and sometimes shook her head.</p>

<p>“You will forget me some day, my husband,” she said.
“You will forget me, and it may be soon. Already have
your thoughts gone back to the woman you first loved.”</p>

<p>“My silly ravings again,” he replied. “Theresa, it
pains me to hear you talk in this way. I shall never fail
in my duty to you.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Harold; you are too good, too noble, too
unselfish. I could never blame you; I love you too well,
and my love is all-sacrificing.”</p>

<p>She pressed hot kisses on his brow, mingled with tears.</p>

<p>“Dear little Theresa,” he said, dreamily, “how you love
me! Ah! sweetheart, a life’s devotion cannot repay such
wonderful love as yours! To-morrow we enter upon a
new life—new scenes, new aspirations, and leave the past
behind.”</p>

<p>He sighed, and for a few minutes Theresa’s face looked
almost happy.</p>

<p>“If I could only believe it,” she thought. “If I could
only believe it! No, no! It is not possible; I am the bar
to his happiness! I am the dread phantom that kills his
peace! But to-morrow—to-morrow shall decide!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THERESA’S WARNING.</p>


<p>Theresa was much more cheerful the following morning.
There might yet be happiness for her and the man
she loved so much. He had declared his intention of
quitting England that very day and devoting his life to
her. Surely her all-absorbing passion for him would meet
with some return!</p>

<p>“I know that the sight of his old love, and the memory
of the old days have revived much that has lain
dormant within him, but he is mine—mine—and I love
him best! Why should she steal away my happiness?
I who am so lonely and sad. If he were free to make
his choice, which would he take? Ah, my love is no
mere outward show. For his sake I would willingly
lay down my life!”</p>

<p>She had forgotten the vendetta, but that very day she
had a note thrust into her hand by an urchin who had
found his way to her apartments unobserved.</p>

<p>In astonishment and horror she opened it and read
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lady Theresa Annesley, daughter of Lambert Egerton and
Theresa Ludovic, remember the death of Count Crispi cries still
for vengeance. You and yours are forever under the ban until
the hateful blood of your people is wiped from off the face of
the earth. Think not to escape us. The executive awaits the
signal to strike.</p>
</div>

<p>In a moment all sunshine was blotted away, and she
stood pale, trembling and hopeless.</p>

<p>In this way Sir Harold found her, and his heart smote
him with remorseless pangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“If you don’t wish it, Theresa,” he said, “I will not
go out at all to-day. Your pallor frightens me. Tell
me, child. What is your trouble?”</p>

<p>He waited anxiously, fearfully. If Theresa asked him
to stay with her, then he might never see Lady Elaine
again. It was a terrible sacrifice, but he was prepared
to make it.</p>

<p>For one brief space she hesitated, then burst into a
storm of tears.</p>

<p>“No, darling, you must not forego every pleasure for
my sake,” she sobbed. “Have I not surrounded you
with a network of perplexities and dangers already? I
am frightened—not for myself, but for my beloved husband!
See! You ought to read this. A danger menaces
you, my love—the danger of death!”</p>

<p>He took the paper, and his face flamed with fury.</p>

<p>“The cowards!” he hissed—“the pitiful, wretched
cowards! Theresa, this is a mere, contemptible threat!
Why was the boy not seized? I will get to the root of
it if half my fortune is spent in so doing!”</p>

<p>He made inquiries from the hotel clerk, the burly <i>commissionaire</i>
in the doorway, the servants about the hall.
Then he was driven to Scotland Yard and placed the
matter in competent hands. Money was no object. The
wretches must be brought to justice, and his wife’s person
properly guarded.</p>

<p>He returned and told her what he had done, and she
said, in reply:</p>

<p>“I am glad for your sake, Harold, but I am very
much afraid. My father ought not to have hidden this
from me!”</p>

<p>Then she looked up at him, with a mournfulness in
her eyes that he never forgot.</p>

<p>“My husband,” she said, “I am going to make a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
request of you—a request which I hope that you will
grant, because I know that it is for your good.”</p>

<p>“Well, Theresa? Sweet one, don’t look at me in that
way! Your eyes will haunt me forever. Now, what is
it you want?”</p>

<p>“Sir Harold, I want you to divorce me! I was reading
only recently in some paper that a marriage under
any serious misapprehension was practically null and void—that
the law would unhesitatingly set it aside. I ask
you this with a breaking heart, because I love you as no
other can love you—knowing that I am but a clog—a
menace to your future happiness!”</p>

<p>“Theresa—Theresa! What has put this madness into
your tender, loving heart?”</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and held her to him tightly.
He showered upon her words of endearment.</p>

<p>“A little while, Theresa, and all these worries will
have melted like mists in the sun. You are too sensitive—too
imaginative. Oh, the thought to me is horrible!”</p>

<p>After lunch, one of the smartest detectives in London
was sent to Sir Harold from Scotland Yard. The liberality
of his reward for the apprehension of the letter-writer
was a strong incentive. He was closeted with
Annesley for half-an-hour, and finally pocketed unimportant
letters and addressed envelopes which had been received
at the hotel since his stay there.</p>

<p>“You must be perfectly frank with me in all things,”
said the detective. “If I appear to be curious concerning
your private affairs I shall only have one end in
view, and that is the elucidation of this little mystery.
My theory is already formed, and I do not think that
I shall be far out when my deductions are complete.”</p>

<p>“You have <i>carte blanche</i> so far as I and my household
are concerned,” Sir Harold told him. “To-night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
we leave for Paris, and you may send me news of your
progress there. I will telegraph my address to you.”</p>

<p>The detective went away, and, half-an-hour later, Annesley
was in a hansom, being driven to Lady Elaine
Seabright’s villa in Hyde Park. He had promised his
wife that he would not be gone long, and left Stimson
to prepare everything for their departure by the Dover
express.</p>

<p>Lady Elaine’s address was Lyndhurst Villa, and Sir
Harold told the cabman to stop within fifty yards of the
house.</p>

<p>When the hansom pulled up he sprang out, and the
man pointed with his whip to a little Queen Anne building
half-embowered in trees, saying:</p>

<p>“That is Lyndhurst Villa, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I shall not be gone long. Wait here
for me, please.”</p>

<p>For a minute his heart beat into his throat, and his eyes
were blinded with mist; then he pushed resolutely onward
into the presence of the one whom he would love
as long as life lasted.</p>

<p>He was admitted by Nina, who conducted him into a
prettily-furnished drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Her ladyship will not keep you waiting long, Sir
Harold,” the maid said, quietly. She could not find it
in her heart to forgive the man who had ruined her mistress’
life.</p>

<p>She withdrew, and in a state of great agitation he
paced the floor. Why had he come? It was needless
pain for both. It was unfair to his wife. He might
have explained all to Lady Elaine by letter. It would
have been much more simple—much easier.</p>

<p>At last there was the rustle of a woman’s dress, the
door opened softly, and his lost love stood before him.
How ethereal she looked. Had the vision appeared unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
he would have believed that it was a visitant
from the spirit world.</p>

<p>“Elaine!”</p>

<p>There was a great sob in his voice, and he held out
his arms, but she did not respond.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold,” she replied, softly. “You must not forget
the bar between us. You must not forget your wife!
I was perhaps wrong to grant this interview, but I wish
to look upon you for the last time—to hear your voice
once more. My hero is not yet dethroned, and I desire
to vindicate myself——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” he cried. “Oh, my God, this is too much for
human hearts to bear! Elaine, come and sit beside me;
let me place my arms about you—pillow your head upon
my shoulder, while I tell you all that has happened to me
since that day when you drove me forth! It may be the
last time, Elaine; it may be the last time that we shall
meet on earth, and I want to carry it through life and to
the grave a pleasant memory. Do not forget what we
have been to each other—what we are to each other still!
When you know all you will not blame me, and then——”</p>

<p>He covered his eyes with his hands, and she was instantly
beside him.</p>

<p>“If I am sinning, Heaven forgive me. Surely the sin
will be expiated by the martyrdom that is mine!”</p>

<p>Bit by bit, he told his wonderful story—the story of
his utter oblivion—the story of his awakening—of his
brotherly love for the sweet girl whom he called wife—of
his utter despair.</p>

<p>“But my duty is clear, Elaine; I could never shut my
eyes to that, although I should be sorely tempted were
Theresa other than she is.”</p>

<p>“I feel that I must love her,” Lady Elaine replied.
“Love her because she loves you, Harold! You see
what my pride—my silly pride—has done for us, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
some way all the evil that has ever befallen me is attributable
to your cousin—to Margaret Nugent. She it was
who professed to know your moods and to whom I
listened blindly for advice. This is no palliation for the
fault—for the folly I committed; but I cannot help thinking
that she had some ulterior motive in parting us—that
she perhaps cared for you herself.”</p>

<p>He was thoughtful for a little while, and then remarked,
sternly: “You cannot both be wrong. Poor
Theresa distrusts Margaret.”</p>

<p>“It is fatal to one’s happiness or even peace to permit
some people to enter into the secrets of their lives,” continued
Lady Elaine, “and I have thought lately that if I
had obeyed the wishes of Colonel Greyson, and permitted
him to carry my letter of recall—my complete surrender—to
you, how different things might have been.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not send that letter, Elaine?” he said,
sadly.</p>

<p>“Ah, you have forgotten, Harold. I sent it by Margaret
Nugent, and she told me that you scoffed at it, and
cast it to the winds.”</p>

<p>“I never received that letter, darling,” he replied, starting
up, a bitter imprecation on his lips against his false
cousin. “I never received that letter—I swear it! At
last I believe that light is breaking upon me! The night
that we first met, Colonel Greyson said that Margaret
would be jealous, and I laughed at what I considered the
absurdity of the idea. And the stories of your engagement
to Rivington? Ah, what a blind fool I have been!”</p>

<p>He heard of the terms of the late earl’s will with wonderment
and regret.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand it, if your father knew nothing
of Rivington’s private character,” he said, “or he may
have been blinded to everything in his obstinacy and determination
to have his own way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>A silver-tongued clock on the mantel-piece chimed the
hour of five, and Sir Harold started up in dismay.</p>

<p>“I must go, Elaine. Kiss me, darling, for the last
time! Oh, the misery of it.”</p>

<p>He embraced her fiercely, saying, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“If you are in trouble at any time call me to your side,
Elaine; I shall never be more than two or three days’
journey away. Promise me, my lost love!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will send to you if my trouble is serious—if
our old lawyer cannot combat with it,” she said.</p>

<p>“And your fortune shall be restored to you. I will see
Mr. Worboys within two months’ time. That will be
soon enough. Between us Rivington can be brought to
his knees. In the meantime I shall not be idle, and will
drop the lawyer a few lines. You will understand later,
Elaine.”</p>

<p>Another frantic, hopeless embrace, and, seizing his hat,
he almost ran from the room—there was a bang of the
outer door, and he was gone.</p>

<p>As the cab whirled away in obedience to his wild words,
“Home again! Lose not a moment!” the figure of a man
appeared from behind a mass of evergreens which grew
in the shadow of a spreading and leafy maple. It was
that of Viscount Rivington.</p>

<p>He took a final glance through the drawing-room window,
where Lady Elaine was kneeling, her face buried in
the cushions of a lounge, paused irresolute, then glided
into the street, a savage imprecation upon his lips, hate in
his flashing, black eyes.</p>

<p>“So this is why my love is spurned!” he muttered.
“Why my life is to be utterly wrecked! He is her lover
still. What unlucky fate has brought them together
again? What of the story of his shattered memory?
God! Has Margaret deceived me also, or is there a mine
beneath her also which is soon to explode? How long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
has he been visiting here? Had I chanced upon them
unawares—but, bah! I saw her in his arms, he a married
man! I heard her sobs, and I hate her for it! Now
it is my turn to woo, aye, and to win! My Lady Elaine
shall be my wife at any cost. I am upon the very brink
of disaster, a disaster which will forever place me beyond
the pale of decent society. I shall be an outcast—a
pariah—a thing to be avoided! I have tried soft measures—tender
appeals, declarations of a love which has
now turned to gall and wormwood! My lady, you have
only yourself to blame, and desperation is my master!”</p>

<p>He looked up and down the street, and continued at a
rapid pace to Hyde Park Corner, from whence he took a
cab to Charing Cross post office. A telegram was sent to
Lady Gaynor, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your presence is required in town. I am staying at the Metropole.</p>
</div>

<p>After a hasty dinner, he decided to play his first card,
and went to the Victoria Hotel in quest of Sir Harold
Annesley.</p>

<p class="center">POOR THERESA.</p>


<p>When Sir Harold reached his hotel he found a note
awaiting him from the detective, which threatened to
alter his plans very materially. It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—You spoke of going to Paris to-night. It is important
that you see me before leaving London, even if your
journey is postponed for twenty-four hours. If you value your
peace of mind, you will not disregard this suggestion, and I will
call upon you at the earliest possible moment with news. I have
every belief that I can lay my hand upon one, at least, of the
despicable wretches who are bent upon the misery of yourself
and Lady Annesley.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="salutation">Obediently yours,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Paul Asbury</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Theresa herself had handed the note to Sir Harold,
and, while his face flushed and paled by turns as he read
it, she watched him with painful eagerness.</p>

<p>“It is from the detective,” he said. “A somewhat ambiguous
message—but must I obey it? Theresa, you
shall be judge. It seems that everything is conspiring
to keep us in London.”</p>

<p>He gave the letter to her, and she perused it with
mixed feelings.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to stay,” she said. “Oh, Harold,
what misery, what danger I have surrounded you with!
I am terrified for your sake. If one of the men is caught
a score may be ready to spring up and avenge him.”</p>

<p>“My dear, the English law will not tolerate anything
of this kind. I will root out the fiends at any cost. It
is a duty I owe to ourselves and society in general. Remember
that they have not a poor man to deal with in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
me. These secret assassins are always cowards, and they
shall be taught a severe lesson.”</p>

<p>Though he spoke thus hopefully, poor Theresa shivered
with a nervous dread.</p>

<p>Dinner was served in private under the direction of
Stimson, who was not ill-pleased at the prospect of remaining
in London a few more hours, at least. In his
secret soul he desired his master to return to Annesley
Park, and live as a rich country gentleman should live.</p>

<p>The meal was hardly finished when Stimson announced
that a gentleman wished to see Sir Harold upon urgent
business.</p>

<p>“His name?” demanded Sir Harold, a little surprised.</p>

<p>“He has not sent it up, Sir Harold. The servant says
that he is waiting in the smoking-room downstairs.”</p>

<p>“My detective, I expect,” Annesley whispered to
Theresa; then aloud to Stimson, “Send him up here. I
will see the gentleman in the anteroom. Now, my little
girl,” he went on, cheerfully, to his trembling wife, “there
shall soon be an end to these cowardly threats. The rascals
shall feel the weight of British law!”</p>

<p>“But you do not know who this man is!” she said,
shivering with a deadly chill.</p>

<p>“I do not anticipate that he is an enemy,” he smiled.
“Besides, Theresa, I am armed, and shall be merciless
enough to shoot the foe like a mad dog!”</p>

<p>He pressed a kiss upon her brow, and noticed that it
was moist and cold.</p>

<p>“The gentleman is here, Sir Harold,” Stimson announced,
adding, in an undertone: “It is Viscount Rivington, sir.”</p>

<p>Annesley’s face flushed with fierce resentment. What
business had the viscount with him? He paused, irresolute,
then said, suddenly, “I will see him.”</p>

<p>With a fond glance of assurance toward Theresa, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
stepped into the anteroom beyond, softly closing the door
of the dining-room behind him.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that you are somewhat surprised to
see me here, Sir Harold Annesley,” Rivington said, in
his smooth, bland tones, rising quickly from a seat in the
corner next to the door. “You will not take my hand?
Well, I cannot help it if you are determined to be unfriendly.
I came to congratulate you upon your recent
marriage, and the recovery of your memory, though I
cannot say that either event has made you particularly
robust or joyful in appearance!”</p>

<p>“What is your business with me?” Annesley demanded,
steadily.</p>

<p>“I came as a friend—an old acquaintance,” Rivington
said.</p>

<p>“I never recognized you as a friend, and I have no
desire for your acquaintance, viscount,” was the cold
reply. “Your impertinence would be amusing if it were
not irritating.”</p>

<p>Rivington laughed sneeringly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you will not accept my friendship, I cannot
help it,” he said. “I hate to be bad friends with any
one.”</p>

<p>“Your friendship and enmity are equally indifferent to
me,” retorted Annesley, raising his voice; “and I should
advise you to retire, or my servant must show you the
door. I have nothing in common with gamblers and
blacklegs.”</p>

<p>He spoke so loudly that every word reached the ears
of the trembling Theresa, and she crept near to the door,
ready to push between her husband and the foe. It was
not the detective; the man’s tones were strange to her.
Who else was he but one of the fiends who was pursuing
her with the relentless certainty of fate?</p>

<p>“A gambler and a blackleg, am I?” cried Rivington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
his voice full of concentrated rage. “Well, granted that
I am, I think that you are the last man on earth to preach
morality, Sir Harold Annesley! To be plain with you, I
am here to warn you against intriguing with women to
whom you have no right! Pray remember, also, that you
are a married man!”</p>

<p>“Scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“Scoundrel to your teeth!” was the bitter retort. “The
kisses of another woman are still fresh upon your lips!
I heard your words of endearment, and as that woman
belongs to me, I have a right to protest against your
secret visits to my house——”</p>

<p>“Your house!” cried Sir Harold, in a white heat of
passion, his features working with a fury that he could
hardly control. “Your house!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear Annesley. There are the papers—agreements
and receipts to prove it. Lady Elaine Seabright
is under my protection, and I was not well pleased
to discover that you had been poaching upon my preserves.
I hate scandal, but I shall undeceive this trusting
wife of yours unless——”</p>

<p>“You craven, lying cur!” thundered Annesley. “Lady
Elaine under your protection—the sweetest, truest woman
that ever lived! You slander her, and I will choke the
words in your lying throat! I have just parted from
Lady Elaine—I admit it. I also admit that I love her
still, and shall ever love her. We drifted apart through
misunderstandings created by serpents of your stamp, and
though there is a legal bar between us, I shall watch over
the woman I love with a never-relaxing vigilance, and an
arm ever ready to avenge!”</p>

<p>He opened the door, adding, “Stimson, see this creature
to the street.”</p>

<p>The viscount tried to smile bravely, but it was only a
ghastly grin. He never knew how he descended the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
broad stairs, but he found himself being advised to “Move
on!” by a burly policeman, who had no sympathy with
his savage gesticulations.</p>

<p>“I have a double reason now for remaining in London,”
Annesley reflected, as he paced the floor in fierce agitation.
“I must see Mr. Worboys to-morrow, and Lady
Elaine must be placed under his protection. Oh, the
coward!—the mean, pitiful coward! What a pleasure it
would have been to lash him until he screamed for
mercy!”</p>

<p>He returned to the room wherein he had left Lady
Annesley, but he was too agitated to notice her ashen
face, or the fire that shone in her dusky eyes.</p>

<p>“It was not the detective,” he said, “but a man whom I
detest. He will not visit me again. Excuse me for a
short time, Theresa; I have letters to write—important
letters.”</p>

<p>He went away, and she murmured:</p>

<p>“Who am I that I should stand between my husband
and all that he loves best? Who am I that I should place
him under the evil ban of the vendetta? If I did not
love him beyond all other things I should not care so
much, but my love is so great that it is all-sacrificing.”</p>

<p>She stared into the fire, the words she had overheard
booming in her ears like the knell of fast-advancing
doom:</p>

<p>“I have just parted from Lady Elaine. * * * I
love her still, and shall ever love her * * * though
there is a legal bar between us, I shall ever watch over
the woman I love!”</p>

<p>“What is my duty?” thought poor Theresa, a resolute
light in her mournful eyes. “My duty is to make my
darling happy. Oh, the burden of my misery is greater
than I can bear!”</p>

<p>For the first time in many days she thought of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Romaic love song that had once haunted her so persistently,
but, oh! how significant it seemed now!</p>

<p>She retired at an early hour to her bedroom, to weep
quietly and to think. No sleep came to her weary, aching
brain. The clocks tolled the hour of midnight before
Sir Harold came. He stepped about softly, believing
that his wife was asleep. Then he pressed a silent
kiss upon her lips, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Poor Theresa!”</p>

<p>The words and the tone rang in her ears to the hour
of her death—“Poor Theresa!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>It seemed that Sir Harold could find little rest. He
was up again at six o’clock, and, after glancing at his
wife, was leaving the room, when she held out her arms
to him in a childish, loving way.</p>

<p>“Kiss me, Harold,” she said.</p>

<p>He obeyed, and she whispered:</p>

<p>“You will always love poor Theresa a little?”</p>

<p>“Can I help doing so, dear one?” he asked. “I should
be a brute, unworthy of the name of man, if I did not care
for you and protect you forever.”</p>

<p>She sighed, and he thought he had never seen her look
so lovely before.</p>

<p>“At a late hour last night the detective made an appointment
to see me at seven o’clock this morning,” he
went on. “I cannot rest in consequence, and shall not
see you again until breakfast time.”</p>

<p>“One more kiss, Harold,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Only one? A hundred, darling, if you want them!”</p>

<p>He looked back as he was leaving the room—the last
time his eyes rested upon her in life!</p>

<p>Poor Theresa!</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</p>


<p>Annesley went to the smoking-room, and read the
morning news until the detective came in. Mr. Paul
Asbury was punctual to the moment, and there was a
gleam of triumph in his eyes that spoke of success and
self-confidence.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Sir Harold,” he said. “I must thank
you for remaining in London at my request, as your
presence will very much simplify matters.”</p>

<p>“What news?” demanded Annesley.</p>

<p>“I have traced the person who wrote the threatening
letter to Lady Annesley, and require further instructions
from you.”</p>

<p>“Go on.” Sir Harold endeavored to be calm, but his
muscles twitched nervously.</p>

<p>“Must I take steps to make an arrest?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I mean to make an example of these people.
Mr. Asbury, allow me to congratulate you upon
your success.”</p>

<p>The detective looked away for a moment, then he said:</p>

<p>“Before you become too enthusiastic, Sir Harold, I
wish you to listen to a few particulars. From the very
first I had no belief in the story of the vendetta, save in
the imagination of Mr. Hamilton. We have investigated
dozens of such stories, and discovered them to be mere
bubbles. Upon leaving you yesterday I telegraphed for
particulars of Lambert Egerton, Count Crispi, and
Theresa Ludovic to no less than four reliable agents
stationed in Italy. The replies satisfy me that the relatives
of Count Crispi made a few threats when the surgeon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
Lambert Egerton, ran away with the ward of his
illustrious client. There the matter ended, save in the
imagination of Egerton himself.”</p>

<p>Annesley shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“But the man who was stabbed in the streets of London—the
man who resembled Egerton?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No such thing ever took place—not as described by
Lady Annesley’s father. My assistants have made an
exhaustive search through the records,” smiled Mr. Asbury.
“The fact is Mr. Hamilton—or Mr. Egerton—became
a monomaniac upon that one subject. His mind
dwelt upon it until he thoroughly believed in it.”</p>

<p>Still Annesley was not convinced.</p>

<p>“The badly-scrawled note that I found upon the night
of his death. How do you account for that?”</p>

<p>“Without a doubt he wrote it himself,” the detective
said, confidently. “I have met with similar cases, Sir
Harold.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Asbury, I am woefully disappointed,” the baronet
said. “Nothing but theory—not one atom of fact. And
yet you talk of making an arrest!”</p>

<p>“Yes; and it depends upon you whether it is wise to
take such a step. You admit having let one other person
into the secret—the secret of this supposed danger that
menaces you and Lady Annesley.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“This person is the author of the last anonymous warning,
and if you insist upon an arrest, you will be called
upon to prosecute your cousin—Miss Margaret Nugent!”</p>

<p>Sir Harold stared at the detective—pale and speechless
for a minute.</p>

<p>The monstrous charge against Margaret appeared too
much to believe. Then he thought of what Lady Elaine
had said—of Theresa’s dislike, and exclaimed, huskily:</p>

<p>“Proof! proof!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“As plain as the nose on my face,” Mr. Asbury smiled.
“I submitted the letter of warning, or whatever the nonsense
may be termed, to one of the best experts in handwriting
in all London, together with an assortment of
the letters you gave me. My expert unhesitatingly declared
that the writer of the letters signed Margaret Nugent
was author of the anonymous one delivered here by
hand. If you are not yet fully satisfied we can find the
boy who brought the letter, though it may occupy several
days. A reward must be offered, and advertisements put
in the papers.”</p>

<p>“The result has shocked me severely,” Annesley said,
after a long silence, “though I am greatly relieved to find
that we have been chased by a mere shadow. I scarcely
know how to break the disgraceful news to Lady Annesley,
and must insist upon Miss Nugent making some
sort of a confession to completely satisfy my wife, whose
health her insane folly has viciously undermined. Mr.
Asbury, I must turn the thing over in my mind for a little
while before giving you my final instructions. I am bitterly
annoyed and ashamed.”</p>

<p>“I can understand that, Sir Harold,” the detective said,
rising.</p>

<p>“One minute, please,” Annesley said. “I am so well
satisfied with your abilities, Mr. Asbury, that I shall
esteem it a favor if you will undertake another little case
in which I am interested.”</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased, Sir Harold, but if you will excuse
me for an hour I shall be glad. I am expecting a cable
from New York which must be answered promptly.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold glanced at his watch. It was exactly eight
o’clock.</p>

<p>“If you like, Mr. Asbury, I will walk with you,” he
said. “I have exactly an hour to spare, and I want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
think how best to approach my wife with this shameful
story.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service, Sir Harold,” was the respectful
rejoinder.</p>

<p>The baronet rang for Stimson.</p>

<p>“I am going out for an hour or two, Stimson. You
will tell her ladyship if she inquires for me.”</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Theresa had dressed, and was
standing at the head of the main staircase when Annesley
and the detective went out.</p>

<p>“Bad news,” she thought, “or my husband would come
to me at once.”</p>

<p>Then Stimson informed her that his master would not
be back for an hour, and she retired to her sitting-room.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sir Harold and Paul Asbury walked
to Scotland Yard. The detective’s business with one of
his subordinates occupied but a few minutes, and he left
the office, looking well pleased.</p>

<p>“Sir Harold,” he said, “one more question, please.
When did Miss Nugent leave you to return to Ashbourne?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some time before my illness—ten or twelve days
since.”</p>

<p>“I have just received information that she left the Victoria
Hotel, and proceeded to the house of a lady friend
in Bayswater, where she is still staying. Now, the sooner
this silly business is exploded the better, or she may be
tempted to perpetrate some new joke. I can now do
nothing more unless I receive instructions from you.”</p>

<p>“Can you furnish me with Miss Nugent’s present address?”
demanded Annesley, savagely.</p>

<p>The detective promptly scribbled a few words on the
back of one of his cards, and gave it to the baronet.
This is the address he wrote down:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Norton</span>, The Laurels, Bayswater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Norton is a lady of fashion,” the detective remarked,
“and her place is well known. If you do not
object, Sir Harold, I prefer to discuss the remaining
business in the Café Royal. It is close here, and I have
a private room upstairs. We never know who is spying
about.”</p>

<p>He stepped briskly along, and suddenly turned into a
low archway facing Trafalgar Square. He opened a
door with his passkey, and ran up three flights of stairs,
at the top of which was a small, dingy-looking room.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” he went on, “one touch upon this electric
button and a waiter appears. I intend having coffee—black
and strong. It is the best nerve sedative I know
of.”</p>

<p>“Order two cups,” said Annesley. “I shall not detain
you five minutes with the new business.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I am going direct to Bayswater.” Mr. Asbury smiled
grimly. He had not told his client all that he knew.</p>

<p>The coffee was promptly served, and Sir Harold began,
briefly:</p>

<p>“It is possible, Mr. Asbury, that you have heard something
of the idle gossip concerning myself and Lady
Elaine Seabright?”</p>

<p>“I know the whole story from beginning to end, Sir
Harold. Even to the later scheming of a swell named
Rivington to secure the late earl’s fortune by a marriage
between himself and Lady Elaine.”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“And that there appears to be every probability of his
success, luckily for him!”</p>

<p>“It is false—utterly false!” Annesley said, fiercely.
“Lady Elaine hates the man, and I want you to protect
her.”</p>

<p>“I hardly understand you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“It is plain enough. I will pay you to keep a man on
the watch—to protect Lady Elaine against any of this
villain’s schemes. Any unusual movement is to be
promptly reported to me, as the man made certain threats
yesterday which have made me uneasy.”</p>

<p>“I understand thoroughly, Sir Harold, and I will say
this much, in confidence, that Viscount Henry Rivington
is already under police surveillance. Upon two separate
occasions have applications been made to the lord mayor
for warrants for his apprehension. By arrangement they
have not been executed, but his safety depends upon his
obtaining the fortune left by the late Earl of Seabright.
His creditors will not be hoodwinked. It is either the
money, for value obtained in many cases under false pretenses,
or his body.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold gave the detective a silent pressure of the
hand, as he rose.</p>

<p>“There is no need for me to say more,” he observed,
reaching for his hat; “I am now going to Bayswater, and
any communication will reach me at the Victoria Hotel.”</p>

<p>The detective nodded, said “good-morning,” and Annesley
hurried downstairs and into the streets, which were
gradually awakening to the usual business of life.</p>

<p>“Nine o’clock,” he reflected. “Theresa will wonder
what has become of me. But this disgraceful conduct of
Margaret must be promptly punished. I will never forgive
her—never.”</p>

<p>He signaled to the first passing cab, jumped in, and
told the man to drive quickly to the Laurels, Bayswater.</p>

<p>Arrived there, he was informed by a flunkey that the
family was out.</p>

<p>“Since when?” demanded Annesley.</p>

<p>“Last night, sir.”</p>

<p>“Miss Nugent, of Ashbourne, has been staying with
Mrs. Norton?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. She and my mistress left for Ashbourne
by the six o’clock train last evening,” the footman replied.</p>

<p>Annesley was bitterly annoyed, but the matter could
not be helped, of course. Unfortunately, he met one or
two people who detained him, and when he reached his
hotel it was half-an-hour past noon.</p>

<p>He ran upstairs, and was met in the anteroom by
Stimson.</p>

<p>“I was just wondering, Sir Harold, what was best to
be done,” he said, “as I did not know what to order for
lunch. I never did feel at home in a hotel.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not consult Lady Annesley?” demanded
Sir Harold, pettishly, and Stimson stared.</p>

<p>“Her ladyship followed you out, master,” he said, a
sense of impending evil suddenly coming over him.</p>

<p>“Followed me! Nonsense, man! You must be dreaming!”
cried the baronet.</p>

<p>“No, Sir Harold! I gave her ladyship your message,
and she just had one cup of tea in her private sitting-room;
then she came out, fully dressed, and told me that
she was going out.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold was bewildered. Still, why should not
Theresa go for a walk if she felt inclined?</p>

<p>He stared blankly at his valet for a few moments; then
he turned suddenly, and walked into his wife’s apartments,
thinking:</p>

<p>“She may have left some written message for me.”</p>

<p>In this conjecture he was right; a sealed envelope, addressed
to him in Theresa’s handwriting, lay on the table
before him.</p>

<p>Snatching it up, he tore open the envelope, took out
the letter it contained, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My darling—my beloved—I am going away from you forever—away
into the unknown shadow land, where I shall be no bar
to your happiness in this world. I have loved you—and shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
ever love you, as no other woman can love—so much that it is
infinite misery to me to know that I am not all in all to you.
I am the bar between you and Lady Elaine; I am even the unhappy
fate that causes my king to be menaced by a cruel death!
At last, Harold, my darling, my beloved, it is ended, but my
spirit will be with you. Good-by. Your unhappy</p>

<p class="center">THE DUKE’S ULTIMATUM.</p>


<p>Viscount Rivington was placed in a terrible dilemma.
The morning after his call upon Annesley he received two
letters at his club—one from Lady Gaynor, and one from
his uncle, the Duke of Rothwell.</p>

<p>The first one ran in this way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Viscount</span>—In answer to your telegram, I must say that
it would be most indiscreet of me to put my head in the lion’s
mouth, as it were. I quite understand your meaning; your plans
have failed, as I predicted, and now you wish to try mine. There
is safety only at the Lodge, and if you will come immediately
matters may be discussed with some hope of success. I greatly
deprecate the waste of valuable time, as things are really growing
desperate with me.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="salutation">Faithfully yours,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Eleanor Gaynor</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The Duke of Rothwell’s letter was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Nephew</span>—Yes, I have no doubt that it is the correct
thing to make your <i>fiancée</i> valuable presents from time to time,
but not at my expense—just yet. I must be satisfied that all is
fair and aboveboard, as I am well seasoned to your crooked
dealings, and I refuse to send you one shilling, and, in addition,
shall stop the allowance I am making you within twenty-four
hours unless I have proof that Lady Elaine Seabright is to be
your wife. I have not an atom of faith in you, and regret more
than ever that I have no son to bear my honored name. This is
my ultimatum: Introduce Lady Elaine to me forthwith, and I
will soon learn for myself how things really are. No more excuses
will do for me.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Rothwell.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“By heavens!” he gasped. “I am ruined—ruined!
Oh, I could gladly choke the life out of the old dotard!
I am on the brink of a volcano that is rumbling at my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
feet, and powerless to move for—what? A paltry two
thousand pounds! And now am I driven to the last
stages of desperation, and there is not a moment to lose.
I must face Isaacs once more, and if the worst comes
to the worst, a pill from this will be the end!”</p>

<p>He tapped his inside breast pocket, his sallow face assuming
a ghastly hue. Then he laughed lightly, curled
the ends of his mustache, and walked from the club
library into the hall.</p>

<p>A cab was crawling past, and he hurried to the street.</p>

<p>“Oxford Circus!” he called to the driver, and jumped
into the vehicle.</p>

<p>As he moved away he saw a man watching him, and he
never forgot the strange look in his eyes. He shivered,
and called himself a fool.</p>

<p>“It is my last throw,” he thought, “and I must keep
my nerves steady. If I fail—exit! Pshaw! Why
should I? The very alternative should give me confidence
and strength.”</p>

<p>He left the cab at Oxford Circus, and strolled along in
a leisurely manner until he reached a narrow court.</p>

<p>Here he paused momentarily, and glanced to the right
and left. Again those eyes haunted him, but the man
was not in the crowd. It was impossible.</p>

<p>Turning into the court, he walked, perhaps twenty
paces, and then entered a foul-smelling hallway, almost
as dark as night. He was evidently well acquainted with
the place, for, without any hesitation, he stepped lightly
up a flight of rickety stairs and knocked sharply at a door
at the top.</p>

<p>It was opened by a middle-aged automaton, of powerful
build, who stared dully at the visitor.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Isaacs within, Bulger?” inquired Rivington.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the viscount!” observed Bulger, after a full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
minute’s reflection. “Yes, sir, he’s in. Do you wish to
see him?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Bulger; most important. Here is half-a-crown
to expedite your movements, old man.”</p>

<p>Bulger took the coin between the dirty fingers of his
right hand, and smiled a wooden smile.</p>

<p>“Thank you, viscount. I hope you are able to settle
with him now.”</p>

<p>He laid particular stress upon the word “now,” and
Rivington understood that things looked pretty bad.</p>

<p>“Announce me,” was all he said, again caressing the
spot where his revolver lay hidden.</p>

<p>He watched the huge form of Bulger disappear within
a farther room, and wondered why the man, who was
by courtesy called the “clerk,” did not strangle the life out
of old Isaacs.</p>

<p>Bulger reappeared, and beckoned to Rivington with
one of his forefingers, supplementing this with a jerk of
his thumb toward the room occupied by the money-lender.</p>

<p>The viscount went in, closed the door behind him, and
dropped languidly into a chair, directly opposite an old
man, whose features at once proclaimed him a Jew. He
was attired in a greasy suit of black, which had evidently
done duty for ten years, at least. His linen and flesh
were equally as dirty as Mr. Bulger’s own, but, unlike his
clerk, he wore a magnificent diamond ring upon one
hooked finger. His nose was like the beak of a hawk,
his eyes deep-set and close together, while his mouth was
full and large, surrounded by a closely-cropped beard and
mustache, as white as snow.</p>

<p>He glanced up at Rivington with a wolfish grin that
disclosed two rows of broken, yellow teeth, and said in
cackling tones:</p>

<p>“In luck, eh, my future duke? For all your confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
last Saturday—yes, it was Saturday! How dared you
come to my private house on a Saturday? For all your
confidence, I did not place much credence in your promise
to be here to-day with the two thousand pounds—just the
interest upon that document of the duke’s—or, I should
say, imitation of the duke’s signature. Well, well, I am
glad that you are at last going to be a man of your word,
and I am sure that the gentle Bulger would not have admitted
you unless you were prepared to pay me. A very
useful fellow, Bulger, and when clients get abusive, he
demonstrates the fact, my dear viscount. He was once
a prize-fighter, and got ten years for killing a man. Then
I took a fancy to him. Splendid fellow for a man to have
about him who has many enemies. Now for the interest—only
the interest upon that little document for ten
thousand!”</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands together and laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Isaacs, you are too fond of anticipating things,”
Rivington began, and was promptly interrupted. In an
instant the face of the Jew underwent an alarming change.
The grin extended, but the eyes glowed like burning
coals.</p>

<p>“No money!” he snarled. “Just as I expected. Why
did Bulger let you in? You lied to him, you thief! I
won’t hear you—not a word! I gave you until noon
to-day. Time is nearly up. At three my lawyer has instructions
to present the bill to the duke himself. Ha! I
will not wait one minute more. I will get principal and
interest, or——”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and touched a bell, in answer
to which Bulger appeared.</p>

<p>“Turn him out!” cried Isaacs. “Why did you bring
him here? He has no money, bah!”</p>

<p>At any other time Rivington would have been sick with
rage and fear, but he was at the end of his tether. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
was faced with the very worst, and had already rehearsed
this scene.</p>

<p>“Leave us, Bulger,” he said, calmly, “or stay, as you
choose. I am not going until I have had some assurance
from Mr. Isaacs——”</p>

<p>“None! None!” screamed the enraged Jew. “I will
not be swindled—oh! you would murder me!”</p>

<p>He cowered back in terror, for Rivington had drawn a
revolver from his coat pocket.</p>

<p>“No—no, Isaacs! Your carrion is not worth a cartridge.
I wish you to understand my position exactly. I
cannot get the two thousand you want until I have secured
Lady Elaine Seabright. Those are my uncle’s own
terms. I shall endeavor to make her mine to all intents
and purposes within three days’ time. If I fail, I shall
put a ball through my brains and cheat my enemies. If
I succeed, everybody will be paid in full. I am really
perfectly indifferent as to what course you take, though I
do not think that you are mad enough to present that bill,
well knowing that you kill my last chance by so doing,
and at the same time lose every shilling of your money.
I am not to be frightened again. Do you not see that I
am perfectly calm and indifferent?” He laughed, adding,
“here is my antidote,” and tapped the handle of his revolver.
“You will either hear of my complete success,
or read of my suicide, Mr. Isaacs, within three days’ time.
Good-morning. Bulger, you may now show me out.
Stay—one moment. It may be possible for you, Isaacs,
to assist me in some way. I do not mean by any further
advances—oh, no; do not mistake me for an instant—I
mean that your brain is so full of infernal cunning that
you may think of something that might assist me out of
this awful predicament. You see, the lady is unwilling,
and has to be persuaded”—he laughed hollowly—“and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
as you have also a great deal at stake, Isaacs, it is to your
interest that I succeed. We are situated in this way.
Now, pay attention, and don’t for one moment think that
I ever dreamed of shooting you. Lady Elaine Seabright
is in London, and will have to be taken before a priest by
force to-night. There is no use in further mincing matters
and playing with fire, and I have to admit that the
undertaking is a most desperate one. A hundred things
may happen to upset my plans, but it is my last throw,
and if I fail—well, you know what to expect.”</p>

<p>He laughed again that strange laugh that struck a
chill even into the heart of the Jew.</p>

<p>“So help me!” gasped Isaacs. “I believe that he is in
earnest this time. He never was but once before, and
that was when he signed the bill. He!—he! Bulger, my
gentle little clerk, the viscount must succeed, and if he
will pay you I will loan you to him. What do you say,
viscount? Your corpse is no good to me. I want my
money—my money!”</p>

<p>Rivington eyed Bulger calmly.</p>

<p>“Probably a good suggestion,” he said. “I cannot
trust my thief of a valet. I do not anticipate violence of
any kind, but one never knows. Bulger, will you meet
me at my club—the Albermarle—at eight o’clock to-night?
Stay, I will meet you instead, say at the corner of
this court. It will be safer. Good-day, Isaacs. If we
ever meet again, it will be under more favorable auspices;
if we don’t, well, you’ll be none the worse off in
the other world.”</p>

<p>He left the money-lender’s office with the feelings of
a victor. He had not experienced so much self-confidence
and peace of mind for years.</p>

<p>Turning into the first telegraph office he came to, he
dispatched the following to Lady Gaynor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am quite in accord with you. Shall arrive by the one-fifty
express. Send carriage to meet train.</p>
</div>

<p>To the Duke of Rothwell he telegraphed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Congratulate me. All is settled. Within the time you stipulate
I shall have satisfied you.</p>
</div>

<p>From the telegraph office he took a hansom to Euston
Station, and just succeeded in catching the express to
Ashbourne.</p>

<p>To an ordinary observer, the viscount was merely a
gentleman of leisure. His face bore no traces of the
inward storms that had raged so recently. He smoked a
fragrant cheroot, and consulted a timetable while the
train was whirling him onwards, now and again making
pencil notes in a small memorandum book.</p>

<p>This done, he tossed the timetable aside, and gave
himself up to reflection until the engine slowed into Ashbourne.</p>

<p>To his relief, if not actual pleasure, Lady Gaynor herself
was at the station to meet him with her pony carriage.</p>

<p>“This is thoughtful of you,” he told her. “It may save
much time. What have you to say to me?”</p>

<p>She touched the ponies lightly, and smiled at him
strangely.</p>

<p>“So you have failed absolutely?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely! To make matters worse, Annesley is
pretty much in his usual form again, and has discovered
her retreat. I was fool enough to blackguard him in the
heat of my jealous passion. Now, then, it is success or
ruin for both. I shall not attempt to face things out,
and if we lose there will be an inquest.”</p>

<p>He looked gloomily away, and Lady Gaynor’s face
became pale under her paint. Like all women, she dreaded
violence and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“Now, then, what are we to do?” he concluded.
“Don’t drive to the lodge. I shall feel that I am being
stifled. We can talk safely here, and you can take me
back to the station after a while. I must catch the next
up-train.”</p>

<p>“I have not much to say,” was Lady Gaynor’s reply;
“but Lady Elaine Seabright must be brought home to-night
without her maid! I have long anticipated this,
and am prepared. I shall expect you and her by the last
train. Your wit must devise the means. Chloroform, or
anything you like. I have an Italian physician staying
with me, and a form of marriage ceremony shall be gone
through, whether my lady wills it or not!”</p>

<p>A strange light flashed into his eyes, and his dark skin
reddened.</p>

<p>“I believe that we shall win, after all,” he said, “and
I will teach my wife to care for me some day. Take
me back to the station, Lady Gaynor!”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">“WE SHALL NEVER MEET AGAIN.”</p>


<p>Lady Elaine was toying with the breakfast that it was
impossible for her to eat, and thinking with a hopeless
kind of bitterness of the misery that had come into her
life, when Nina suddenly entered the room, her face betraying
strong agitation.</p>

<p>“My lady, there is a person in the drawing-room who
insists upon seeing you. I cannot say whether she is
young or old, but I fancy that she must be young by the
sweetness of her voice. She is closely veiled, and speaks
nicely.”</p>

<p>Nina stopped to regain breath, adding, “She will not
give her name, my lady.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to be bothered, Nina,” said Lady Elaine,
wearily. “This is an extraordinary hour for visitors.
Possibly the person is engaged in some charitable pursuit.
Tell her that she can state the nature of her business to
you.”</p>

<p>“I have done everything in that way, my lady,” the
maid declared. “I think that it will be best for you to
see her.”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot be bothered. I am weary of everything,
Nina.”</p>

<p>Then the maid stammered: “I was to tell you, my lady,
that—that she came from Sir Harold Annesley.”</p>

<p>Lady Elaine started, her face turning deathly white.
Was Sir Harold ill? Had some fresh misfortune befallen
him?</p>

<p>“You are sure of this, Nina?” She held one hand to
her throbbing heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Quite sure, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Then I will see her. Bring the lady to me here.
This room is warm, and I fear that I dare not try to
walk. My limbs are shaking with nervous dread.”</p>

<p>Nina glanced at her mistress, a pitiful look in her eyes,
and left the room.</p>

<p>One minute, and she returned, a black-robed, girlish
figure behind her.</p>

<p>“A mere girl,” thought Lady Elaine. “How could
Nina be doubtful whether she were young or old?”</p>

<p>“This is the lady from Sir Harold Annesley, your
ladyship,” said Nina.</p>

<p>Elaine rose and bowed to her visitor, and was conscious
of being closely scrutinized.</p>

<p>Then, at a sign from her mistress, Nina softly withdrew,
and the stranger spoke.</p>

<p>The tones were soft, tremulous, and flute-like, and
there was a world of pathos in every note.</p>

<p>“You are Lady Elaine Seabright?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Elaine said, gently. She knew not why her
heart went out in tenderness to this black-robed figure.
Perhaps it was in sympathy, because she, too, mourned
a lost one.</p>

<p>“You are very beautiful, Lady Elaine,” continued the
visitor, half-dreamily, “and I have wanted to see you so
much! I wanted to see the woman whom Sir Harold
loved first—and loves best.”</p>

<p>A haughty light flashed into Elaine’s eyes, but the
words that rose to her lips were checked by the girl
tossing aside her veil, and revealing a face of wondrous
beauty.</p>

<p>“I am Theresa,” she said. “I am Sir Harold’s unhappy
wife.”</p>

<p>She dropped into a lounge, and shed passionate tears.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
In a moment Elaine was beside her, and murmuring
soothing words to poor Theresa.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand why you should come here,
Lady Annesley,” she said. “Sir Harold loves you
fondly. Why should you call yourself unhappy!”</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you. Oh, I have longed so much to
see you—to know if you were good and true! My husband
loves me, yes, but not as he loves you. While in
the delirium of fever he told me so, and I know that he
has seen you recently—that a bitter parting has taken
place between you. Lady Elaine, you will never know
how happy we were once, in the garden of roses, where
I learned to worship my king. Oh, if I could have died
then, what a blissful death it would have been!”</p>

<p>“You must forget that Sir Harold and I ever cared
for each other,” Lady Elaine said, gently. “It is all
over and past, you and he are now husband and wife.”</p>

<p>Theresa looked at her mournfully.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you,” she went on, “and now I am
satisfied. I do not wonder that he loves you best. I
have heard much of the shameful story which parted
you, and then Sir Harold only married me out of pity
for my helplessness, while I loved him, even as you may
never love him, Lady Elaine! For my sake he has
sacrificed all that makes life worth the living. He does
not know that I am here—he will never know unless you
tell him. He does not even dream that I have any knowledge
of your whereabouts; but I wished to look upon
your beautiful face once, and that is why I am here.”</p>

<p>“Lady Annesley, I have parted from Sir Harold forever,”
Elaine said. “He came here yesterday to say
good-by. His words concerning you were only words
of love.”</p>

<p>Theresa did not reply, but gazed wistfully at Lady
Elaine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“Kiss me once,” she said, after a little while. “I am
going now, and we shall never meet again!”</p>

<p>Elaine knew not what to say. After all, Theresa was
but a child, and she pressed her lips fondly to the girl’s
cold cheek.</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall meet again, Lady Annesley,” she whispered.
“In the future, when the pain in our hearts is
less. After all, life is but a feverish dream, and our
longings are never satisfied.”</p>

<p>Theresa smiled sadly, but there was a sweet, saintly
expression on her lovely face that Elaine never forgot.</p>

<p>“I am much happier now that I have seen you,” she
said. A long-drawn sigh escaped her, and she added
“Good-by.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and Lady Elaine walked with
her into the hall, the door of which was standing open,
for the early autumn morning was warm and balmy.</p>

<p>There was a last farewell, and then the lovely, little,
black figure was gone.</p>

<p>An inexpressible mournfulness seemed to be in the
very air, and for a long time Elaine wandered from
room to room, a strange feeling of unrest upon her.
She could not forget the sorrowfulness of Theresa’s last
good-by. It seemed to echo about her like a voice from
the spirit world.</p>

<p>Late in the evening the little household was startled
by an imperative knock, followed by a sharp ring at
the doorbell.</p>

<p>The woman who did the duty of housekeeper obeyed
the somewhat noisy summons, and a man handed her a
sealed letter, saying:</p>

<p>“For Lady Seabright. Hurry up, ma’am; there’s an
answer wanted!”</p>

<p>Nina received the letter from the housekeeper, and
promptly conveyed it to her mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>This is what Elaine read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lady Elaine Seabright is requested by Sir Harold Annesley’s
medical adviser to come to the Victoria Hotel at once if she
wishes to see Harold alive. He has met with a street accident,
and is fast sinking. His one desire is to see Lady Elaine before
he dies. Her ladyship is advised to lose not an instant, but to
accompany the bearer of this urgent appeal. A closed carriage
has been sent for her exclusive use.</p>
</div>

<p>She read the letter twice, and then stood white and
rigid. Had this anything to do with Lady Annesley’s
visit? What tragedy had been committed?</p>

<p>“Nina,” she said, “Sir Harold is dying. He has sent
for me. You must help me dress at once! I am going
to him. Fetch my hat and cloak. That is all I shall
want.”</p>

<p>“My lady, must I accompany you?” the maid asked,
after rapidly obeying the order.</p>

<p>“No, Nina; I do not see the necessity for it. I may
have to remain all night. Oh, merciful Heavens!
How disaster follows upon the heels of disaster!”</p>

<p>In a few minutes she was ready, and Nina followed
her to the door.</p>

<p>“How dark it is, my lady!” she said.</p>

<p>A huge figure loomed forward, and a man’s voice said:</p>

<p>“The kerridge is here, my lady. I ain’t had no time,
your ladyship, to light my lamps; in fact, the order came
so sudden that I clean forgot ’em.”</p>

<p>“Lead the way,” commanded Lady Elaine.</p>

<p>The man obeyed, and she saw a four-wheeled cab
harnessed to a powerful horse.</p>

<p>“Do not sit up for me,” she said to Nina, “I will telegraph
to you in the morning.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the carriage, the door was banged
fast, and the next moment the horse plunged away under
the stinging lash of the whip. Almost at the same instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
Lady Elaine felt that she was not alone, and a
terrible dread seized upon her. What did it mean?
Against the purple darkness of the night, through one
of the windows, she had clearly seen a man’s profile!
Then, as her eyes became accustomed to the blackness
about her, his form was apparent like a misty shadow.</p>

<p>A cold chill seemed to rest upon her heart, but, by a
desperate effort, she spoke:</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if Sir Harold’s condition is as hopeless
as the physician appears to think in the note he has
sent to me?”</p>

<p>She waited, but there was no reply. The strain was
too awful to bear. She uttered a wild shriek, and a
hand was clapped to her mouth, while a sinewy arm
clasped her waist. She gasped for breath, and then relapsed
into insensibility under the powerful fumes of
something pressed to her palpitating nostrils.</p>

<p>The man pulled the checkstring, and the carriage
stopped.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bulger,” said the voice of Viscount
Rivington. “Drive carefully now, so that we do not attract
any needless attention. Straight to Sim’s alley,
King’s Cross.”</p>

<p>Like a man bereft of all reason, Sir Harold Annesley
paced his wife’s room, the words of her last letter seeming
to eat into his brain like molten fire.</p>

<p>“Poor Theresa!” he said, at last. “What must have
been your mental sufferings to drive you to this? A
life’s devotion can never repay such wonderful love as
yours!”</p>

<p>He clasped one hand to his burning brow, and looked
about him mournfully. The place was fragrant with her
sweet presence, like the perfume of a flower that is dead.</p>

<p>He stepped to the window, and gazed at the busy
crowd below. Then the full force of Theresa’s meaning
burst upon him, and he cried aloud in his agony.</p>

<p>He reverently placed the letter in his pocketbook, and
rang for Stimson. The valet was near at hand, and
came quickly into the room.</p>

<p>“Lady Annesley has gone away, Stimson,” his master
said, brokenly, “has left me with some mistaken
notion of giving me my freedom. She heard something
last night, when I was angry with that scoundrel, Rivington—something
concerning Lady Elaine Seabright,
and her heart is broken. Stimson, I must find her if all
London has to be searched. Her words may be wild
and irresponsible, but my heart reproaches me sorely.
Now, try and remember what she said to you last, and
how she looked.”</p>

<p>The valet could only repeat what he had already
stated.</p>

<p>“It seems,” Sir Harold said, “that the fates are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
against me. I have been detained at every turn against
my will.”</p>

<p>He sprang up resolutely.</p>

<p>“There is nothing that you can do, Stimson, and I am
incapable of sustained thought at present. Within an
hour, though, the whole machinery of the law shall be
put in motion.”</p>

<p>He stepped swiftly away without another word, and,
jumping into a cab, was driven to Scotland Yard once
more.</p>

<p>The inspector readily granted him an interview, and
listened in amazement to his latest trouble.</p>

<p>“Only an hour since I learned from Asbury that the
anonymous letter-writer was within reach when wanted,
and I concluded that your troubles were nearly at an
end, Sir Harold,” he said.</p>

<p>“This is merely an outcome of the disgraceful affair,”
Annesley replied, savagely clinching his hands. “My
poor wife has evidently been driven out of her mind with
fear—more upon my account than her own. Now, sir,
what can be done?”</p>

<p>“Notice must be promptly given to every police station
in the metropolis. The railway station and hotels must
be watched. Now, if she had less start of us, the matter
would be as simple as A B C. For the present, leave it
in my hands, with a carefully-written description of Lady
Annesley’s dress, etc. I have no doubt that Asbury has
the whole case at his fingers’ ends, and I really do not
think that you have reason for so much alarm. Women
take strange fancies into their heads at times, Sir Harold.
Let us hope that you will find her at your hotel when
you get back.”</p>

<p>Annesley shook his head. “The moment that Mr.
Asbury is available let him come to me,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that he is not here now,” was the reply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
“I telephoned to his private office only a few minutes
before you came in, and hear that he is out of London
until the evening. You may depend, however, that we
will do our best for you, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p>Annesley went back to his hotel, but there was no
news of Theresa. He sent for copies of the evening
papers, and was almost afraid to read them, lest there
should be some awful story concerning his wife.</p>

<p>At this unhappy moment Stimson announced Miss
Margaret Nugent, and a wild hope sprang into his
heart, to be as quickly dispelled when he saw his cousin
standing before him alone, wonder and alarm in her
face at sight of his misery.</p>

<p>“So it is you!” he cried, harshly.</p>

<p>“Harold—dear Harold!” Margaret said, “what is the
matter? I am leaving London to-day for home. Until
last night I have been visiting a friend living at Bayswater,
and I have come to see Theresa—because I have
been very miserable about something.”</p>

<p>“You have driven her from me—perhaps to her
death,” he replied, flashing upon her a glance of bitter
contempt, “wretched woman that you are!”</p>

<p>“You know, then——” she murmured, her lips white
and dry.</p>

<p>“Know!” he sneered. “I have had detectives following
your every movement. I will have you made a public
example of unless you bring my wife back to me,
slanderer and liar that you are!”</p>

<p>She dropped upon her knees before him, and sobbed
bitter tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Harold! this from you to me! I who have
loved you so well! Let my love for you be my excuse.
I have hated all who have seemed to come between us;
first, Lady Elaine, and then poor, confiding Theresa.
Since I penned that wretched letter my life has been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
torture to me. I have been appalled by the misery that
I and Viscount Rivington have already caused you, and
yet the gulf between us has but widened. And now I
am humiliating myself as woman was never humiliated
before. I came back to-day to tell your wife all. I
knew that she would forgive me—if she could not forget.
I knew that I shall never forgive myself. Do you
not believe me, Harold? Do you not see that I have
hardly been responsible for my actions? I think that I
must have been mad! I have only just realized the
hideousness of my folly—of my wickedness. My love
for you, and my jealousy of all others who came between
us, have blinded me utterly and completely. Pity me,
Harold, though I am not deserving of one moment’s
consideration from you. Remember the old days—the
old days of our childhood—when I deemed that you were
all my own. Remember when you petted me, and made
me love you! and I never dreamed that any other girl
could come between us. I regarded you as my very
own! Was it not I who waited in patient expectancy for
your return from abroad? Was it not I who gloried
in your conquests? And then, when I believed that I
was about to taste the sweets of life, the bowl was
ruthlessly snatched from my lips. God and myself alone
know the bitterness of my trial! I hated all who stood
between you and me. I hated Lady Elaine Seabright—I
hated the gentle-hearted Theresa; but I have been
mad—mad! But at last I have wakened, and it shall
be my duty to make atonement!”</p>

<p>Her anguish was terrible to see, but he said, sternly:</p>

<p>“If my innocent Theresa is not restored to me I will
never forgive you, Margaret Nugent. I will never look
upon your hateful face again! There is no pity in my
heart for you—there never will be. Go, and find
Theresa!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>She rose to her feet, her face wet with tears, and turning,
silently left him. No punishment could equal the
anguish that had pierced her heart. The man whom
she had sinned for spurned and hated her!</p>

<p>“I will find Theresa,” she whispered to herself; “and
I pray to God that I may not be too late, or I shall
live hereafter marked with the brand of Cain!”</p>

<p>She did not seek advice anywhere, but went straight
to Euston station. She asked for a ticket to Tenterden,
but was informed that no further trains stopped there
that day. Her only hope of reaching Tenterden was to
book to Crayford, and return to Tenterden by a local
train. Even by doing this she ran great chances. If
the London train was not in exactly to time at Crayford
the last local would have left.</p>

<p>“Then I must trust to chance,” Margaret thought.
“In any event I have to go to Ashbourne to-night, and
that is only one station beyond Crayford.”</p>

<p>As the booking clerk had anticipated, the train was
late at Crayford, and Margaret continued to the station
nearest her home, deciding to go to Tenterden the next
morning.</p>

<p>In the meantime the day wore late, and still no news
came to Sir Harold. It seemed that in a few hours he
had aged years.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock Paul Asbury came to the hotel, and
there was a look of pity in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I have everything in hand,” he said, reassuringly,
in answer to Sir Harold’s appealing glance; “and all
that we can do is—wait! The next few hours are pregnant
with big results. I will stay with you if you will
permit it. My men have instructions to telephone to me
here.”</p>

<p>“There is some hope, then?”</p>

<p>“There is always hope,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Annesley told the detective of Miss Nugent’s visit that
day. Then he wanted to know if Asbury had formed
any theory concerning his wife.</p>

<p>“If she had left here at night, I should have feared for
the worst,” he said. “Impulsive people do strange
things in the dark. The river, you know! However,
that is quite out of the question, as Lady Annesley left
the hotel in the early morning. You say that she had
no friend in the world save yourself—not even an acquaintance;
but I will tell you this much, Sir Harold, I
believe your wife visited Lady Elaine Seabright this
morning. A lady enveloped in black was seen to enter
Lady Elaine’s villa, and leave half-an-hour later. They
parted upon the best of terms. I may be wrong, but I
incline to the belief that this lady was your wife.”</p>

<p>Annesley was strangely moved, but he knew not what
to think.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock before Asbury was called to the
telephone, and he obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he was back, his eyes sparkling with
excitement.</p>

<p>“Two calls almost simultaneously. Sir Harold, your
wife was seen at Euston station this morning. Be of
good cheer! We shall find her. The second item is
even more important. Lady Elaine Seabright was inveigled
from home at ten o’clock, drugged, and taken to
a certain house in King’s Cross by Viscount Rivington
and an ex-convict named Bulger.”</p>

<p>Sir Harold started up wildly.</p>

<p>“The lady must be released,” continued Asbury; “and
I think that it is quite time to stop the viscount’s little
career. Come; you can be of no use here.”</p>

<p>Annesley followed him out of the room almost
mechanically—received his hat and overcoat from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
attentive Stimson, and the two were driven rapidly in
the direction of King’s Cross.</p>

<p>“It will probably be all over when we arrive,” the detective
explained. “I issued my orders lest the wily
snake gave us the slip. This is a last desperate move
on the part of Rivington. His confederate, Lady Gaynor,
will be arrested to-morrow upon the charge of obtaining
money and jewelry under false pretenses.”</p>

<p>At length the cab pulled up with a jerk, and Asbury
jumped out, followed by Annesley, whose blood was
boiling with indignation.</p>

<p>A man in uniform was promptly by the side of Asbury,
and said:</p>

<p>“A doctor is with her ladyship, and the viscount is
dead—shot hisself, sir, and laughed while he did it.
Bulger’s locked up!”</p>

<p>“Poor devil,” was the grim rejoinder. “So he has
given us the slip!”</p>

<p>They went into the house, and in a minute Annesley
was bending over Elaine, one of her hands clasped in
his.</p>

<p>“You are not hurt?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; I shall be better soon. I cannot understand
anything yet; my head throbs and burns so much. I
knew that you would come to me, Harold!”</p>

<p>The light of a great love was shining in her eyes; then
she added:</p>

<p>“Oh, forgive me; I had forgotten—all but your presence
here!”</p>

<p>“Do not try to think now,” he whispered, tenderly.
“You must return home, and Nina will take care of you.
To-morrow you may know all.”</p>

<p>She sighed softly, content that the man she loved was
near her!</p>

<p class="center">PEACE AT LAST.</p>


<p>At the urgent request of Annesley the doctor consented
to accompany them back to the villa in Hyde
Park and remain in the house all night. He feared
that Lady Elaine might be severely shocked when the
events of the past hour recurred vividly to her, and
wished to feel sure that she would have proper attention
at hand. She was tenderly lifted into a carriage by
Annesley, and the doctor sat opposite them.</p>

<p>“I will see you at an early hour to-morrow morning,
Sir Harold,” Paul said at parting. “You may expect
news at any time.”</p>

<p>Elaine slept through the journey, and hardly a word
passed between Annesley and the doctor, the young
man’s heart was so full of his cruel grief.</p>

<p>When the villa was reached her ladyship was led indoors
in a half-dreamful state, and Sir Harold hastened
to reassure the terrified Nina.</p>

<p>“You are not dying, sir!” the girl cried. “Oh, what
a wicked hoax!”</p>

<p>Annesley said nothing. This was no time for explanations
and investigations. He introduced the old
doctor, promising to call early in the morning, and was
driven back to his hotel.</p>

<p>He looked into his wife’s empty room, and wept such
tears that men only can weep. He did not undress or
attempt to rest. Where was the use of it? The remainder
of the night was spent in pacing the floor and
thinking of the absent Theresa.</p>

<p>With the advent of daylight a little hope came to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and he indulged himself to the extent of a bath. This
refreshed him a little, and the sounds of life in the house
and the streets told him that there was something to be
done. Only in activity could he find relief.</p>

<p>He waited feverishly for the post, but there was only
a letter from Colonel Greyson in answer to a telegram.
The colonel was coming home at once.</p>

<p>Then Paul Asbury came in. He had no news yet.
It was a little too early.</p>

<p>Even while he was speaking a telegram was handed
to Sir Harold, and he opened it with trembling fingers.
It was from Margaret Nugent, and ran:</p>

<p>“I have found Theresa. Come to the little cottage at
Tenterden.”</p>

<p>He passed it to Asbury, and the detective read it
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I have sent a man down there this morning,” he said.
“We are forestalled. The next train does not leave
until eleven o’clock—the one by which your wife went
there yesterday. It is now barely half-past eight.”</p>

<p>“I will go to Hyde Park first,” Annesley replied. “I
will see if my wife really called upon Lady Elaine. Asbury,
what do you think of this telegram? It has filled
me with dread. I am afraid that something has happened.”</p>

<p>“It is like a woman to be vague,” the detective said,
evasively. “I do not think that I can be of any further
use to you now,” he went on, “but do not forget I am
ever at your service.”</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Paul Asbury went away, while
Annesley gave his valet some hurried orders.</p>

<p>“My wife has gone back to Tenterden,” he said; “I
am going to her at once, Stimson, and, if all is well, shall
take her to the Park. You will hear from me during
the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Harold.”</p>

<p>Stimson was very pale. He had just been reading of
the suicide of Viscount Rivington, and many strange
details in connection with it.</p>

<p>It was barely half-past nine when Annesley’s cab
pulled up before the villa in Hyde Park.</p>

<p>He was admitted by Nina, and, in answer to his eager
inquiries, heard that her mistress was completely recovered.</p>

<p>“The doctor thought it useless to remain,” she concluded,
“and has been gone an hour. Oh, Sir Harold,”
with quivering lips, “I have read it all in the papers!”</p>

<p>“The papers! Ah!” he exclaimed, “I had forgotten!”</p>

<p>He followed Nina into the morning-room, where Lady
Elaine was seated, and a faint flush mounted to her
cheeks when he entered.</p>

<p>“You are well, almost?” he said, taking one of her
thin hands between his own.</p>

<p>“As well as I can ever be, Harold.”</p>

<p>Some way she could not help addressing him in the
old, familiar manner. He was her lover still, though
another had a stronger claim upon him.</p>

<p>“I have read all in the newspaper this morning,” she
shuddered. “I did not realize the danger I had been in
until then, and, but for you, Heaven alone knows what
may have happened!”</p>

<p>“Now that Rivington is dead you are free,” Annesley
observed, “and I should advise sending for Mr. Worboys
at once.”</p>

<p>“I will do as you wish, Harold,” Elaine replied. “It
is possible that we shall leave here to-day, but I will let
you know soon.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Worboys had better write to my lawyer,” Annesley
said, and she flushed redly, saying, “I had forgotten.
You will forgive me, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>He looked at her, pained and startled.</p>

<p>“I did not mean that, Elaine—not in that way; but of
course you have not heard of my possible change of
plans—how could you? You have not heard that my
wife has left me, and been traced to her own home in
the village of Tenterden? I am going to her now, and
if all is as I wish it to be, we shall go home to the
Park.”</p>

<p>Then Lady Elaine told him of Theresa’s visit to her,
and much of what had passed between them.</p>

<p>He listened with tear-dimmed eyes, and only murmured,
“Poor Theresa!” How many times had he said
this of late!</p>

<p>He said good-by to Lady Elaine, and he believed that
it was forever; then he went away, and was driven
rapidly to Euston. From Euston he was whirled to
Tenterden, and then walked through the old, familiar
ways to the cottage embowered in trees and flowers.</p>

<p>“My little Theresa,” he thought, “I wonder if she is
waiting for me? Oh, how kind I will be to the sensitive,
loving child, and may Heaven punish me if I ever
neglect my duty to my wife in thought, word or deed.”</p>

<p>He turned in at the gate, and in fancy saw Theresa’s
face peeping at him round the porch. Then he shivered,
for all was still, with a silence that spoke of death.</p>

<p>He placed his thumb on the latch of the cottage door,
and when it opened he was met by Margaret Nugent.
In loathing he turned away, saying: “Where is she—where
is Theresa?”</p>

<p>She pointed solemnly upstairs, and he bounded up the
steps two at a time, as though madness was in his veins.</p>

<p>“Theresa! Theresa!” he cried, “I am here!”</p>

<p>He stepped into the bedroom, and saw her before him
in the sweet dream of death—her hands folded over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
breast, and beside her a huge bunch of the flowers that
she had loved so well.</p>

<p>He kissed the dead face, that even now seemed to
smile up at him; he shed bitter tears, for he knew that
poor Theresa had died for love of him!</p>

<p>They had found her that morning in the old summer
arbor—cold and still. Her heart was broken.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Immediately after his wife’s funeral Sir Harold went
abroad. The sympathy of his friends was as distasteful
to him as the slanderous gossip of the careless and
vicious. Never before within the memory of mortal
man had the county been in such a turmoil! Following
the viscount’s suicide, Lady Gaynor had vanished
like a shadow, leaving her servants and debts behind
her.</p>

<p>The parting between Lady Elaine and Sir Harold was
one that was never forgotten by either. With the concurrence
of Mr. Worboys, she had made her home with
a widowed sister of Colonel Greyson in a lovely little
place among the hills and vales of lovely Kent.</p>

<p>“I will never lose sight of him, Elaine,” the colonel
said, “and the future may yet be filled with golden promise!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A year passed and the wanderer returned, and soon
after there was a quiet wedding from the house of
Colonel Greyson’s sister. The guests did not number
more than a dozen. There was no ostentation—no display—but
their way from the church was strewn with
flowers, and the bells throbbed with melody.</p>

<p>They went direct to Annesley Park—Sir Harold and
Elaine—to the quiet enjoyment of their own home.
Their parting had been so long and so bitter that every
hour now was too precious to be lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes they walk hand in hand to the graveyard
where poor Theresa lies, and her last resting place is
kept fresh and fragrant with flowers, not by their hands
alone, but by those of a repentant woman who passes
by on the other side—Margaret Nugent! And when
Sir Harold and his wife think of all these things, and
bless Heaven for bringing them together at last, the sorrows
of the past grow less and less, merged into the fullness
and beauty of the present.</p>


<p class="center">THE END.</p>


<p>In “A Wife’s Peril,” which will be No. 51 of the <span class="smcap">New
Bertha Clay Library</span>, Miss Clay has written an attention-gripping
story of a wife’s struggle and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Are welcomed by most everybody, no
matter what their particular preference
may be, in the way of reading matter.
The books in the New Magnet Library
by Nicholas Carter are real detective
stories, not merely chronicles of bloodshed
and crime. True, there must be
a crime if we have a criminal, but
evil is always punished in these stories—which
is as it should be.</p>

<p>There is hardly a reader in America who has not read this
author’s “Ishmael” and “Self-Raised.” They are classics of the
people, and no author of popular fiction has ever been more
justly praised, nor held a more secure position in the hearts of
American readers than Mrs. Southworth.</p>

<p>After the two books just mentioned, her “Hidden Hand” is
best known, but in addition to these books there are dozens of
others which are known the world over.</p>

<p>All of Mrs. Southworth’s work is strong in plot, and her character
drawing is worthy of a Dickens, or a Thackeray, or a Poe.
This line contains all Mrs. Southworth’s copyrighted books, and
is the only authorized edition of her work.</p>
